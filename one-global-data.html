                                            Learning Opportunity 9 Directions: Read the paragraph and answer the questions below. Despite historic progress on developing new tools to fight COVID-19 including nine vaccines listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for emergency use -- inequitable access means the pandemic is actually worse today than it was a year ago. Last December, I wrote about COVID-19's confirmed global death toll of 1.5 million. Just one year later, that number stands in excess of 5 million. So far, the world has delivered 7 billion vaccines and counting, but they are being distributed unequally. According to Our World in Data, more than eight times as many boosters are administered globally every day than are primary doses in low income countries. It is a global injustice, and the most vulnerable people remain the most at risk. Only 1 in 4 health care workers in Africa have been fully vaccinated despite serving on the pandemic's front lines, for example, according to WHO. QUESTIONS 1. What is the main topic of the text? 2. What is the tone of the text? 3. Is the writer positive about covid-19 vaccines?

The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created a global health crisis that has had a deep impact on the way we perceive our world and our everyday lives, (https://www.frontiersin.org). Philippines, one of the high-risk countries of this pandemic has recorded high cases of the disease.

The number of people who got infected in d days is represented by the function (d). This data can be used to better understand the spread of COVID-19 in a certain part of the Philippines and to create a more effective response plan.</p><p></p><p>For example, by analyzing the trend in the number of infected people, it may be possible to predict future outbreaks and take preventive measures to control the spread of the disease. By using mathematical models such as exponential growth models or logistic models, it may be possible to estimate the rate of transmission, the potential number of cases, and the effectiveness of different interventions.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, by comparing the data with other regions or countries, it may be possible to identify best practices and develop more effective strategies for controlling the spread of COVID-19. By using mathematics in this way, it is possible to create a more accurate picture of the situation and make informed decisions that can help to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.</p><p></p>#<strong>C</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>y</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>g</strong><p></p><br />

                            13. What is meant by 'one planet living'?
a. reducing expenses in order to efficiently manage human population growth
b. engaging in more global markets to increase customer data and profitability
c. adjusting resource usage so as not to use more resources than are renewable
d. consuming resources that benefit growing markets and address social issues</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>One planet living</strong> is simply <strong>adjusting resource usage</strong></p><p></p><p>In sum, <strong>one planet living</strong> is a vision where humans will have to use natural resources that are available in mother earth. As one may know, with each passing day and with each usage of natural renewable or non renewable resource, some day there will be resource scarcity or even complete disappearance of it. </p><p></p><p>Thus, the goal of<strong> one planet living</strong> is to make use of the resources available in this planet with great attention and realization that it will disappear some day. Every person living on the earth can take any action that will benefit this vision. Most of the times, small act that we do towards preserving the environment will also count. </p><p></p>In addition, here is the explanation of each choice in the original question:<p></p><p>a. Reducing expenses to manage population growth is not the definition of <strong>one planet living</strong>. This is, instead, heavily tied with efficiency in budgeting and economy. In addition, more population means more usage of natural resources, which would contribute in a faster rate of resource declining.</p><p></p><p>b. This definition is closely related to profit-seeking rather than environment-driven statement. Average business model would benefit from this statement, however, there is no correlation to '<strong>one planet living'</strong> as a vision.</p><p></p><p>c. Adjusting resource usage aligns with the goal of<strong> 'one planet living'</strong> as a vision. Adjustments in using resources will result in efficiency of its usage, so the already available resources would not decrease faster than it already is.</p><p></p><p>d. Lastly, resources usage whose end goal is to benefit the human themselves (markets and social issues) is not what is meant with <strong>'one planet living'</strong>, as this statement is more focused on consuming and benefiting for the humans, not resources-driven.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about<strong> one planet living</strong> by clicking this link: https://brainly.ph/question/20026505</p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

                            23. Learning Opportunity 9 Directions: Read the paragraph and answer the questions below. Despite historic progress on developing new tools to fight COVID-19 including nine vaccines listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for emergency use -- inequitable access means the pandemic is actually worse today than it was a year ago. Last December, I wrote about COVID-19's confirmed global death toll of 1.5 million. Just one year later, that number stands in excess of 5 million. So far, the world has delivered 7 billion vaccines and counting, but they are being distributed unequally. According to Our World in Data, more than eight times as many boosters are administered globally every day than are primary doses in low income countries. It is a global injustice, and the most vulnerable people remain the most at risk. Only 1 in 4 health care workers in Africa have been fully vaccinated despite serving on the pandemic's front lines, for example, according to WHO. QUESTIONS 1. What is the main topic of the text? 2.
