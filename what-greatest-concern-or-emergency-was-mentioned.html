                                            Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this
continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that
all men are created equal.
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate we can not consecrate - we can not hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here. dedicated to the great taak remaining before us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

                        <p><strong>The Gettysburg Address </strong>is the speech given by former US President Abraham Lincoln. It is to give dedication to the soldiers who risked and sacrificed their lives during the civil war.</p><p></p><strong>The speech alone is a primary source of information</strong> but the details inside the address can be considered as secondary. This is because the speech is all about the civil war and the main speaker happens to be former President Abraham Lincoln. The reason why we consider it a primary source of information is that it is directly given by President Abraham Lincoln. It was not altered, nor part of any research paper.<br /><br /><strong>It means 87 years.</strong> At the start of the speech, the speaker mentioned about four scores and seven years. This means that there are 20 years in a score and then we would add the 7 years. This would sum up to a total of 87 years. It also refers to the year 1776. The same year when the independence was signed by the founding fathers.<br /><br /><strong>Democracy. </strong>In his speech, Lincoln assured us that in the upcoming years, the country and its officers will continue to fight for its freedom. It will continue to serve people the justice and right everyone deserves as what the founding fathers promised on their signed paper. He also promised that the sacrifices made by the soldiers and army will forever be remembered as part of history.<br /><br /><strong>It means that the government shall serve the people</strong> because it is the people that make the government possible. the government's role is to manage the country but from Abraham Lincoln's point of view, it is the people that shape the government. Without the cooperation of the people, the government would be a complete waste. It is the people that mandate what will be the future of a government.<br /><br /><strong>Inauguration of a military funeral in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. </strong>The speech was made for the fallen soldiers and to dedicate their heroic actions during the civil war. It was one of the deadliest and bloodiest wars in history so Abraham Lincoln paid tribute to their sacrifices.<p></p><p>If you want to learn more about the Gettysburg Address, you may head over to this link directly:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/3694274</p><p></p><p><strong>#SPJ2</strong></p><br />

Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

This war intends to stop the Southern States (the Confederacy) from seceding or moving away and creating their own country, effectively splitting the US into different two countries.The phrase "government is of the people, by  the people and for the people" means a <strong>democratic government</strong>, wherein the people who constitute the government are people who came from the people or masses (of the people). It is a type of government where officials were voted, or selected (by the people)
. A government who aims to improve the overall welfare of everyone (for the people).The speech was given during the <strong>dedication o the Soldier's National Cemetery </strong>in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.
