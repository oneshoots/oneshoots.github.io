The solute is the component that does the dissolving. 2. The solvent is the component that is being dissolved 3. Matter can be classified as pure substance or mixture. 4. A suspension is a cloudy mixture whose particles settle when allowed to stand for some time. 5. Fine mixtures are those with particles bigger than the particles of suspensions and colloids. 6.Solubility is the maximum amount of solute that can be dissolved in a given amount of solvent at a specific tenperature. . A supersaturated solution can be prepared by adding more solute to a saturated solution while increasing its temperature. 7. A solution may be qualitatively described as saturated, unsaturated or supersaturated solution. 8. If the solution contains more dissolved solute than the saturated solution, it is supersaturated, which is unstable condition. 9. Coinpounds can be decomposed into their component elements through chemical means, often using heat, light or electricity. 10. A pure substance can either be an element or a compound. 11. Mixtures consist of two or more substances that are physically combined in no definite proportion, 12. Dilute solutions have relatively high amount of solute. 13. Concentrated solutions contain relatively low amount of solute, True 14. A colloid has properties intermediate of a solution and a suspension and exhibit tyndall effect.​</a>

Write TRUE ifyou think a statement is correct and FALSE if the statement is incorrect. Writeyour answer on the space provided.1. Burning of fossil fuels is one main sources of carbon dioxide emission.2. In a natural greenhouse effect, less heat escapes into space thusthere is more re-emitted heat in the Earth's surface.3. Ozone layer prevents heat from escaping the earth that result to therising of earth's temperature.4. Global warming refers to the rise in global temperatures due mainlyto the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in theatmosphere.Tony5. 2019 is the hottest year on record, according to NASA.6. Climate change can bring about a rising of the sea level due to themelting of ice caps and glaciers, stronger typhoons, and heavierrainfalls.7. More greenhouse gases will mean high temperature.8. Glaciers that cover land will melt which will result in the rise of sealevels.9. More emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasesthreatened all living things.10. The gas that mainly contributes to the rising of global temperature ismethane.​</a>

                                            Directions: Read the passage about "Climate Change vs. Global Warming" thenformulate 5 questions based on it.Climate Change Definition vs. Global Warming DefinitionAccording to the US Geological Survey, global warming is just one aspect of climatechange. In fact, they say that global warming refers to the rise in global temperatures duemainly to the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. On the otherhand, climate change refers to the increasing changes in the measures of climate over a longupperiod of time - including precipitation, temperature, and wind patterns.Following the same line of thought, according to Climate.Gov, global warming refersonly to the Earth's rising surface temperature, while climate change includes warming andthe side effects” of warming-like melting glaciers, heavier rainstorms, or more frequentdrought. Ultimately, this means that global warming is one side of the much larger problemof human-caused climate change.Questions:1. ______________________2. ______________________3. ______________________4. ______________________5. ______________________kahit tattlo lng po ppleasefollow ko mag aanswer Ng TAMA at free brainliest</a>

Directions: Read the passage about "Climate Change vs. Global Warming" thenformulate 5 questions based on it.Climate Change Definition vs. Global Warming DefinitionAccording to the US Geological Survey, global warming is just one aspect of climatechange. In fact, they say that global warming refers to the rise in global temperatures duemainly to the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. On the otherhand, climate change refers to the increasing changes in the measures of climate over a longupperiod of time - including precipitation, temperature, and wind patterns.Following the same line of thought, according to Climate.Gov, global warming refersonly to the Earth's rising surface temperature, while climate change includes warming andthe side effects” of warming-like melting glaciers, heavier rainstorms, or more frequentdrought. Ultimately, this means that global warming is one side of the much larger problemof human-caused climate change.Questions:1. ______________________2. ______________________3. ______________________4. ______________________5. ______________________kahit tattlo lng po ppleasefollow ko mag aanswer Ng TAMA at free brainliest</h2><br />

The water molecules need more energy to produce enough pressure to escape the boundary of the liquid. The more salt (or any solute) added to water, the more you raise the boiling point.</p><p>5. <strong>Concentration of solutions</strong>  - a solution forms when a solute dissolves in a solvent. The concentration of a solution is a measure of how 'crowded' the solute particles are.
