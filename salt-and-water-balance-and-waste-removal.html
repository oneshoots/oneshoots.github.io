                                            Activity 1: In your notebook, transcode the information below into an appropriate non-linear representation. Now, let's read the following text and complete the given task. The human body is made up of 65 percent water and an average of eight to ten cups is needed to replenish our bodies each day. The amount of water a person needs depends largely on the volume of urine and sweat lost daily. The need for water increases if a person suffers from diarrhea, vomiting or undergoes physical exercise. Water lost should be replenished by drinking liquids that do not contain caffeine or alcohol; both of which increase the output of urine and thus, dehydrate the body. Some types of food, are also a good source of water. Fruits and vegetables consist of 80 to 95 percent water, while meat is made up of 50 percent. In addition, grains such as oats and rice can contain as much as 35 percent water. A person can survive only eight to ten days without water, whereas it takes weeks to die from lack of food. Water circulates through our blood and lymphatic system, transporting oxygen and nutrients to cells and removing waste through urine and sweat. Water also maintains the natural balance between dissolved salts and water in cells. Our joints and soft tissues depend on the cushioning effect that water provides. Although water has no caloric value and is not considered an energy source, it is vital in our diet to help digest and absorb food.​</a>

The process becomes possible thro bean-shaped organ called kidney. Every human being has a pair of responsible for the disposal of waste materials like urea from the bl make this possible, the kidney has filtering units called nephrou general, the kidney has two functions. First, it removes the liquid solution from the blood in the form of urine. Second, they also keeps s and balance the other substances and the salts in the blood, and prod hormones that aid in the formation of blood.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The problems of living in an aquatic environment seem small indeed compared with the problems of life on land. Since animal bodies are mostly water, all metabolic activities proceed in water, and life itself was conceived in water, it might seem that animals were meant to stay in water. Yet many animals, like the plants preceding them, moved onto land, carrying their watery composition with them. Once on land, terrestrial animals continued their adaptive radiation, solving the threat of desiccation, until they became abundant even in some of the most arid parts of the earth.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Terrestrial animals lose water by evaporation from respiratory and body surfaces, excretion in urine, and elimination in the feces. They replace such losses by water in the food, drinking water when available, and retaining metabolic water formed in cells by oxidation of foods, especially carbohydrates. Certain insects—for example, desert roaches, certain ticks and mites, and the mealworm—are able to absorb water vapor directly from atmospheric air. In some desert rodents, metabolic water gain may constitute most of the animals’ water intake.</p>The problems of living in an aquatic environment seem small indeed compared with the problems of life on land.

Now, let's read the following text and complete the given task. The human body is made up of 65 percent water and an average of eight to ten cups is needed to replenish our bodies each day. The amount of water a person needs depends largely on the volume of urine and sweat lost daily. The need for water increases if a person suffers from diarrhea, vomiting or undergoes physical exercise. Water lost should be replenished by drinking liquids that do not contain caffeine or alcohol; both of which increase the output of urine and thus, dehydrate the body. Some types of food, are also a good source of water. Fruits and vegetables consist of 80 to 95 percent water, while meat is made up of 50 percent. In addition, grains such as oats and rice can contain as much as 35 percent water. A person can survive only eight to ten days without water, whereas it takes weeks to die from lack of food. Water circulates through our blood and lymphatic system, transporting oxygen and nutrients to cells and removing waste through urine and sweat. Water also maintains the natural balance between dissolved salts and water in cells. Our joints and soft tissues depend on the cushioning effect that water provides. Although water has no caloric value and is not considered an energy source, it is vital in our diet to help digest and absorb food.​</h2><br />
