What helpful insights can you draw from this activity</p><p></p><p>An entrepreneur is a person who strategically identifies a product or service and the possible means of distributing it to gain profit. Being an entrepreneur is not an easy task for you have to consider many things. Everybody has a possibility to be a good entrepreneur and with proper assessment, you may identify the skills that you do best and those which you need to work out. For this, you need to take into consideration the Personal Entrepreneurial Competencies (PEC) to determine what your good and bad points.</p><p></p><p>What is Personal Entrepreneurial Competencies (PEC)</p><p></p><p>Personal Entrepreneurial Competencies are list of attitudes and skills that an entrepreneur should possess. As much as possible, it is important to have all these skills to be a successful one. Others have it innately while some needs to work it out. These competencies are listed below:</p><p></p><p>Opportunity Seeking - you see a possible product or service in which you can grab to gain profit. You always notice a means to make it possible for distribution.</p><p></p><p>Persistence - every entrepreneur is expected to be tough and strong. With his goal in his mind, he keeps on pushing through to make the business existing and operating. Whatever circumstance that may arise, not being hard headed, he keeps on pursuing what is the best for the company.</p><p></p><p>Commitment - it is somewhat synonymous to persistence because one of the reasons why you are persistent is that you are very committed to the business process. It can manifest in your actions and decisions when hard times occurs in the business. Also, it can be shown by exerting extra effort to make the business flow smoother and finer.</p><p></p><p>Risk-Taking - this is where entrepreneurs differ from each other. Most of entrepreneurs of this time are risk takers, grabbing every opportunity that comes to the business even though some areas are uncertain of what may happen next. Though others are not taking the risk, there is nothing wrong in their decision. Maybe, the company may suffer a lot when they go into something that they are not sure about so they prefer working in a safe setting.</p><p></p><p>Demand for Efficiency and Quality - it is expected to the entrepreneur to require the most efficient process of producing products and services without sacrificing the quality of it.

When you know your objectives, you can eliminate unnecessary actions and save a lot of effort and resources while upholding the quality of the product or service offered.</p><p></p><p>Information Seeking - proper feedbacking is very important to an entrepreneur. He should be open minded to criticisms for they are the steps for better service. To be able to stay in the market and the competition, you will need a lot of information that may help you, even the information coming from your competitors. A healthy information gathering from you customers will do the trick.</p><p></p><p>Systematic Planning and Monitoring - a good entrepreneur sets up proper and easy-to-understand protocols and processes to make the business run smoothly. Proper preparation and consideration of many factors will help you to formulate your business process.</p><p></p><p>Persuasion and Networking - the success of the business also depends on how broad and wide is your customer's patronage. Always remember that satisfied customers will always tell what is good in your business. It is also expected from entrepreneurs to use proper, convincing, and compelling words that may help you and your customer in spreading the word.</p><p></p><p>Self-confidence - this is the most innate attribute of the entrepreneur. It is important that you believe in yourself and in your business because no one will do it for you. You must trust your judgement and decisions, considering what is good for you, for the business, and the people under your supervision. A boosted morale can unlock doors of opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Significance of identifying PECs</p><p></p><p>You  will know your good traits. From can start from there. Do not be discouraged because you don't have the other skills. As you run through your business, you may improve those you are lacking.</p><p></p><p>You can improve your skills by learning from others whom you know may help you out. Try to be someone's subordinate first then learn how they manage and run their business.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
