                                            Read the article below and make an outline using the mapping method. Wolf Communication - Part of Wolf Society By: Zack N PaulyThe Big Bad Wolf who threatened the three little pigs the wolf who disguised himself as a grandmother and ate Little Red riding Hood. The story of the little shepherd boy who cried "Wolf!" a lone wolf howling in the moonlight - all these familiar images of the wolf have one thing in common they give a false picture. Contrary to stereotypes born out of human fear, the wolf is not a cold-blooded killer of humans, nor is it a solitary hunter. In fact, wolves are very family-and pack-oriented and have a rich social life, which they maintain by communicating with each other in a variety of interesting ways. These wolf communication behaviors include facial contact, howling, and scent marking. Facial contact behaviors, the most intimate type of wolf communication, closely resemble what humans do when they nuzzle their babies or hug and kiss one another as a greeting. Wolves use nose pushing, cheek rubbing, facial licking, and jaw wrestling to greet one another, to give a friendly welcome, or sometimes to show dominance For example, jaw wrestling - a behavior in which two wolves mouth one another's jaws - can be a greeting or it can be a way of intimidating another, lower-ranking wolf If one wolf puts its mouth over another's muzzle, it is giving a sign of friendship But if the first wolf has its teeth bared, the greeting is not so friendly it is the wolf's way of establishing itself as the more dominant, or more important, member of the wolf pack.Howling is another important way that wolves communicate You may think that wolves howl because they are lonely, but in fact they usually howl for social purposes Barry Lopez, author of the book Of Wolves and Men, says that wolves probably don't howl during a chase, but often do howl after a hunt, "perhaps to celebrate a successful hunt (the presence of food), their prowess, or the fact that they are all together again, that no one has been injured" Wolves howl often during breeding and courtship times (in the winter), and more often in the evening or early morning. However, contrary to popular belief, they don't howl at the moon, and they don't howl any more often when there is a full moon.Wolves also communicate by scent marking. Wolves leave scent marks to define their territory as if to erect an invisible fence that only other wolves with their keen sense of smell can detect. They mark their territory partly for the same reasons that we put our names and initials on our books, mailboxes, sweaters, bracelets - to say, "This is mine." Scent marks help a wolf to know if it is in its own territory. They may even keep a pack together. How exactly do wolves leave scent marks? They urinate, defecate, or scratch the ground every few minutes as they are traveling. And wolves on the move stop every few minutes to inspect scent marks left by other wolves. The more we learn about these and other forms of wolf communication, the better we understand the complex social structure of wolf packs. Perhaps by gaining insight into these magnificent animals - who form enduring relationships, just as humans do we can learn more about ourselves and our place in the world of nature. ​</a>

                            6. Read the article below and make an outline using the mapping method. Wolf Communication - Part of Wolf Society By: Zack N PaulyThe Big Bad Wolf who threatened the three little pigs the wolf who disguised himself as a grandmother and ate Little Red riding Hood. The story of the little shepherd boy who cried "Wolf!" a lone wolf howling in the moonlight - all these familiar images of the wolf have one thing in common they give a false picture. Contrary to stereotypes born out of human fear, the wolf is not a cold-blooded killer of humans, nor is it a solitary hunter. In fact, wolves are very family-and pack-oriented and have a rich social life, which they maintain by communicating with each other in a variety of interesting ways. These wolf communication behaviors include facial contact, howling, and scent marking. Facial contact behaviors, the most intimate type of wolf communication, closely resemble what humans do when they nuzzle their babies or hug and kiss one another as a greeting. Wolves use nose pushing, cheek rubbing, facial licking, and jaw wrestling to greet one another, to give a friendly welcome, or sometimes to show dominance For example, jaw wrestling - a behavior in which two wolves mouth one another's jaws - can be a greeting or it can be a way of intimidating another, lower-ranking wolf If one wolf puts its mouth over another's muzzle, it is giving a sign of friendship But if the first wolf has its teeth bared, the greeting is not so friendly it is the wolf's way of establishing itself as the more dominant, or more important, member of the wolf pack.Howling is another important way that wolves communicate You may think that wolves howl because they are lonely, but in fact they usually howl for social purposes Barry Lopez, author of the book Of Wolves and Men, says that wolves probably don't howl during a chase, but often do howl after a hunt, "perhaps to celebrate a successful hunt (the presence of food), their prowess, or the fact that they are all together again, that no one has been injured" Wolves howl often during breeding and courtship times (in the winter), and more often in the evening or early morning. However, contrary to popular belief, they don't howl at the moon, and they don't howl any more often when there is a full moon.Wolves also communicate by scent marking. Wolves leave scent marks to define their territory as if to erect an invisible fence that only other wolves with their keen sense of smell can detect. They mark their territory partly for the same reasons that we put our names and initials on our books, mailboxes, sweaters, bracelets - to say, "This is mine." Scent marks help a wolf to know if it is in its own territory. They may even keep a pack together. How exactly do wolves leave scent marks? They urinate, defecate, or scratch the ground every few minutes as they are traveling. And wolves on the move stop every few minutes to inspect scent marks left by other wolves. The more we learn about these and other forms of wolf communication, the better we understand the complex social structure of wolf packs. Perhaps by gaining insight into these magnificent animals - who form enduring relationships, just as humans do we can learn more about ourselves and our place in the world of nature. ​</h2><br />
