I believe that would be the most suitable advice and recommendation you can hear from someone my age. 6) ________, follow always unto what you really want. 7) _______, I would like to highlight is the crucial value of your dreams as, like the great Steve Jobs pointed out, the way to success is to "dream bigger", and this tool is available for everyone. There has barely been one person in the world that had never failed, so, you, most probably, will not become such an exception. 8)_______, do not limit yourself by the fear of losing, you will lose one day anyway, and this occasion is unpredictable and unpreventable. It may sound absolutely discouraging but have a think about it: if there is nothing to hold you back, everything is possible. With this in mind, make a bold, confident, and reckless step in the life, hurry to fall, 9)_________ the sooner you will do this, the more time you will have for getting back to the top. 10)________ do not let the obstacles and failures stop you as they are just other twists of a great life adventure you are to embark on and we are looking forward to witness. Thank you and congratulations!​</a>

                                            The Law of Choice
Marian Leanna dela Cruz
1
”Cross my heart and hope to die!”
2
If you were an elementary school-age kid at any point in your life, you’d be familiar with the phrase above. These words get thrown around on playgrounds, school corridors, and street curbs more often than a Chinese jackstone or a basketball. You probably swore your own death several times as a child, just so you can prove a point to your playmate.
3
The fulfillment of morbid oaths aside, children instinctively know the relevance of keeping one’s promises. See little Juana going on at length about the Chickenjoy that her mother said she could have, if only she behaved during grocery shopping. See Junior hunched over a piece of bond paper, coloring materials spread around, finishing a drawing he said he will show his teacher the next day. Children hold promises dear, and thankfully, so do older people. Why must you do this, though.
4
One reason why people should fulfill promises is because it makes everyone involved feel good. You gain faith in your own ability to accomplish something, and others see you as a reliable person. For example, your shelves need arranging, and your mother pointed this out to you. If you tell her you’ll fix your shelves in an hour, actually accomplishing this will make both you and your mother happy. Not only because your shelves are tidier but because you were true to your word. Put this in contrast to the awful feeling of having nothing to show after the allocated time. Indeed, keeping your word will help you build your confidence and self-respect. When you are able to keep your promise, you convince yourself that you are able to handle a similar situation, should it come in the future.
5
Also, a promise can be seen as on-the-job training. Later in life, keeping promises will help you be professional at work. Most jobs have deadlines and project termination dates. If you are good at keeping promises, you would be able to come up with a service or a product before the deadline. Your employment relies heavily upon your performance, and meeting deadlines is just the start of it.
6
It must be said that a promise is, first and foremost, a choice. It is a personal decision to fulfill a promise, and as such, it is also a personal decision to break it. The reason why people fail to keep their promises sometimes is rooted here. According to psychologist and writer Farouk Radwan, you should consider three things when you are about to make a promise:
7
The first is self-understanding. You should be able to tell what things you are likely to enjoy doing, which ones are chores for you, and those which you absolutely cannot abide. “For example,” he writes, “If you don’t know that working under pressure is the last thing you would want to do in life you might promise your manager to finish all of your work in few hours, [then you might start feeling the pressure].” According to Radwan, if you understand how you work, you
will not make promises you cannot keep.
8
Related to the first is Ability If you do not know your own limitations, you might take on projects that you are not able to finish. For instance, if you offer to have all 3000 pages of your report photocopied, and you find that you’re exhausted at the 1500-paper mark, then you have just discovered your personal photocopying limit (to the detriment of your group).
9
Finally, there is practicality Some things just cannot be accomplished, given the time frame. No matter how much you like doing something, or how proficient you are at it, if the external conditions (like time and place) are not right, you will not be able to fulfill your promise. For example, you would want to cash a check for your company, but you found out that the bank is closed. It doesn’t matter if you enjoy what you’re doing; fact is, no one will be able to attend to you
10
Choosing to make promises is a rewarding thing, if you are able to keep them. When you keep a promise, you are building not only others’ trust in you but your trust in your own capabilities. And when you keep a promise, in effect, you are telling the other person that they are important to you. As writer John Green said in The Fault in Our Stars, “Some people don’t understand the promises they’re making when they make them [...] but [they] keep the promise anyway. That’s what love is. Love is keeping the promise anyway.”</a>

What makes an effective leader? To be sure, no one characteristic or trait defines an effective leader. It is true, however, that effective leaders get the most out of employees or group members by holding them to very high standards or expectations. Setting high standards increases productivity because people tend to live up to the expectations set for them by superiors. This is an example of the Pygmalion effect, which works in a subtle,
often unconscious way. When a managerial leader believes that a group member will succeed, the manager communicates this belief without realizing that he or she is doing so. Conversely, when a leader expects a group member to fail, that person will not usually disappoint the manager. The manager’s expectation of success or failure becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Thus it pays for a manager to expect the best from employees. 
(Adaptedfrom Andrew J. DuBrin, Leadership 4/e, © Cengage Learning.)
_____14. What is the main idea of this passage?
A. Called the “Pygmalion effect” i.e. expect the best and you'll get it
B. People are likely to live up to a manager's or superior's expectations
C. Effective leaders encourage a high level of performance by expecting the best from their employees
D. Leader who expects the best gets high achievement
Those cuddly stuffed animals called teddy bears seem to have been around forever. But actually the first teddy bears came into being when President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt showed himself too much of a sportsman to shoot a staked bear cub. In 1902, Roosevelt visited Mississippi to settle a border dispute. In Roosevelt’s honor, his hosts organized a hunting expedition. To make sure that the president would bag a trophy, they staked a bear
cub to the ground so that Roosevelt’s shot couldn’t miss. To his credit, Roosevelt refused to shoot the bear.

                            15. The Law of Choice
Marian Leanna dela Cruz
1
”Cross my heart and hope to die!”
2
If you were an elementary school-age kid at any point in your life, you’d be familiar with the phrase above. These words get thrown around on playgrounds, school corridors, and street curbs more often than a Chinese jackstone or a basketball. You probably swore your own death several times as a child, just so you can prove a point to your playmate.
3
The fulfillment of morbid oaths aside, children instinctively know the relevance of keeping one’s promises. See little Juana going on at length about the Chickenjoy that her mother said she could have, if only she behaved during grocery shopping. See Junior hunched over a piece of bond paper, coloring materials spread around, finishing a drawing he said he will show his teacher the next day. Children hold promises dear, and thankfully, so do older people. Why must you do this, though.
4
One reason why people should fulfill promises is because it makes everyone involved feel good. You gain faith in your own ability to accomplish something, and others see you as a reliable person. For example, your shelves need arranging, and your mother pointed this out to you. If you tell her you’ll fix your shelves in an hour, actually accomplishing this will make both you and your mother happy. Not only because your shelves are tidier but because you were true to your word. Put this in contrast to the awful feeling of having nothing to show after the allocated time. Indeed, keeping your word will help you build your confidence and self-respect. When you are able to keep your promise, you convince yourself that you are able to handle a similar situation, should it come in the future.
5
Also, a promise can be seen as on-the-job training. Later in life, keeping promises will help you be professional at work. Most jobs have deadlines and project termination dates. If you are good at keeping promises, you would be able to come up with a service or a product before the deadline. Your employment relies heavily upon your performance, and meeting deadlines is just the start of it.
6
It must be said that a promise is, first and foremost, a choice. It is a personal decision to fulfill a promise, and as such, it is also a personal decision to break it. The reason why people fail to keep their promises sometimes is rooted here. According to psychologist and writer Farouk Radwan, you should consider three things when you are about to make a promise:
7
The first is self-understanding. You should be able to tell what things you are likely to enjoy doing, which ones are chores for you, and those which you absolutely cannot abide. “For example,” he writes, “If you don’t know that working under pressure is the last thing you would want to do in life you might promise your manager to finish all of your work in few hours, [then you might start feeling the pressure].” According to Radwan, if you understand how you work, you
will not make promises you cannot keep.
8
Related to the first is Ability If you do not know your own limitations, you might take on projects that you are not able to finish. For instance, if you offer to have all 3000 pages of your report photocopied, and you find that you’re exhausted at the 1500-paper mark, then you have just discovered your personal photocopying limit (to the detriment of your group).
9
Finally, there is practicality Some things just cannot be accomplished, given the time frame. No matter how much you like doing something, or how proficient you are at it, if the external conditions (like time and place) are not right, you will not be able to fulfill your promise. For example, you would want to cash a check for your company, but you found out that the bank is closed.

Choosing to make promises is a rewarding thing, if you are able to keep them. When you keep a promise, you are building not only others’ trust in you but your trust in your own capabilities. And when you keep a promise, in effect, you are telling the other person that they are important to you. As writer John Green said in The Fault in Our Stars, “Some people don’t understand the promises they’re making when they make them [...] but [they] keep the promise anyway. That’s what love is. Love is keeping the promise anyway.”</h2><br />

What makes an effective leader? To be sure, no one characteristic or trait defines an effective leader. It is true, however, that effective leaders get the most out of employees or group members by holding them to very high standards or expectations. Setting high standards increases productivity because people tend to live up to the expectations set for them by superiors. This is an example of the Pygmalion effect, which works in a subtle,
often unconscious way. When a managerial leader believes that a group member will succeed, the manager communicates this belief without realizing that he or she is doing so. Conversely, when a leader expects a group member to fail, that person will not usually disappoint the manager. The manager’s expectation of success or failure becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Thus it pays for a manager to expect the best from employees.

Those cuddly stuffed animals called teddy bears seem to have been around forever. But actually the first teddy bears came into being when President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt showed himself too much of a sportsman to shoot a staked bear cub. In 1902, Roosevelt visited Mississippi to settle a border dispute. In Roosevelt’s honor, his hosts organized a hunting expedition. To make sure that the president would bag a trophy, they staked a bear
cub to the ground so that Roosevelt’s shot couldn’t miss. To his credit, Roosevelt refused to shoot the bear. When the incident was publicized, largely through political cartoons, a Russian candy store owner named Morris Michtom made a toy bear out of soft, fuzzy cloth and placed it in his shop window with a sign reading “Teddy’s Bear.” The bear was a hit with passersby, and teddy-bear mania spread rapidly throughout the country. Soon, Teddy's bear was the country's most popular toy, the teddy bear.
