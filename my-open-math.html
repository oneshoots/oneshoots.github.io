                                            Read the following texts. Identify each one as coherent and cohesive or cohesive but not coherent. Write your answer on yellow paper. 1. My sister is addicted to computer games. She spends almost half of her allowance in playing computer games at internet café. She said it makes her happy and relieves her stress. Despite her pleas, I decided to cut her allowance so she will not have enough money to spend in playing computer game. 2. Klein reached the top of the mountain. He likes mountain bikes. He also bikes around the town every now and then. Our town is such a peaceful and beautiful place. I feel so beautiful everyday. Everyday should be taken as a chance to start anew. 3. Studying is so fun for me. It is not very interesting for most students but it is for me. I love waking up early every morning with a thought that I will be learning a lot of new things again. I especially enjoy attending math class because I like challenging myself to solve problems that I know I have difficulty with. I sincerely hope that my fellow students will learn to appreciate how fun studying is much as I do, so that going to school will no longer be a burden for them. 4. Writing is not one of my interests. I always have a hard time expressing myself through writing. Nevertheless, I am open to learning new things which is why I am allotting extra time in reading books about writing. I get frustrated most of the time when I feel like I do not make any improvements at all in writing despite exerting so much effort. In spite of this, I know that I should not give up until I finally turn this weakness into one of my strengths. 5. Myles bought a new phone. She likes buying new things. Shopping is one of her favorite pastimes. Pasta and desserts are also her favorite. She does not like overcooked pasta though. There was one time when she tried cooking pasta. The result was not just overcooked, but it was burnt.​</a>

Daniel was nervous about going to Patricia's birthday party. He was afraid that he wouldn't know anyone but Patricia, and she would be so busy with her guests. "Mom, I don't want to go to the party." Daniel's mother furrowed her brow and said, "Daniel, we already told her we'd be there. We bought her a present. We have to go and give it to her." Daniel shook his head. He still didn't want to go. His mom put her hand on his shoulder. Point of View: 4. Pete didn't feel like doing homework. He felt like playing baseball. He grabbed his mitt off the shelf and began to fantasize about being out in the field. His fantasy was interrupted shortly by the opening of his bedroom door. It was his mom. She started to yell, "Pete, you're not failing baseball class! You're failing math class! You need to study. Put the mitt away!" Pete put the mitt away, but he didn't know the first thing about studying math Point of View 5. If you are confused about something in class, don't wait. Raise your hand and ask for help immediately.

                            13. Read the following texts. Identify each one as coherent and cohesive or cohesive but not coherent. Write your answer on yellow paper. 1. My sister is addicted to computer games. She spends almost half of her allowance in playing computer games at internet café. She said it makes her happy and relieves her stress. Despite her pleas, I decided to cut her allowance so she will not have enough money to spend in playing computer game. 2. Klein reached the top of the mountain. He likes mountain bikes. He also bikes around the town every now and then. Our town is such a peaceful and beautiful place. I feel so beautiful everyday. Everyday should be taken as a chance to start anew. 3. Studying is so fun for me. It is not very interesting for most students but it is for me. I love waking up early every morning with a thought that I will be learning a lot of new things again. I especially enjoy attending math class because I like challenging myself to solve problems that I know I have difficulty with. I sincerely hope that my fellow students will learn to appreciate how fun studying is much as I do, so that going to school will no longer be a burden for them. 4. Writing is not one of my interests. I always have a hard time expressing myself through writing. Nevertheless, I am open to learning new things which is why I am allotting extra time in reading books about writing. I get frustrated most of the time when I feel like I do not make any improvements at all in writing despite exerting so much effort. In spite of this, I know that I should not give up until I finally turn this weakness into one of my strengths. 5. Myles bought a new phone. She likes buying new things. Shopping is one of her favorite pastimes. Pasta and desserts are also her favorite. She does not like overcooked pasta though. There was one time when she tried cooking pasta. The result was not just overcooked, but it was burnt.​</h2><br />
