                                            19. A prospective client has come to see you and explained that she has been threatenedwith a lawsuit claiming breach of an oral contract. Although you never take art cases, youpolitely hear the prospective client relate the facts and hear her deny having promised to sell aPicasso to the prospective plaintiff and wanting to sell it to another purchaser for much more thanthe prospective plaintiff claims she promised to take. You then tell the prospective client thatyou steer clear of art cases and you decline to represent her. A week later the prospectiveplaintiff contacts a partner in your firm and asks her to represent him in a suit against prospectiveclient to enforce an oral contact to buy a Picasso from prospective client. Having turned downthe representation of prospective client, you opened no file, took no other action with respect toher, and did not disclose any information she disclosed to you to anyone in your firm. Yourpartner agrees to represent prospective plaintiff. Is there a problem here?  Yes or No? Why? Model Rule 1.18(c): Prospective clients; is there imputation?​</a>

                                            Steps in a Trial Motion for Directed Verdict/Dismissal At the conclusion of the plaintiff's or government's evidence, the lawyer will announce that the plaintiff or government rests. Then, when the jury leaves the courtroom, the defendant's lawyer in a civil case has the option of making a motion for a directed verdict, arguing that his or her client's liability has not been proven by a preponderance of the evidence. In a criminal trial, the defendant's lawyer can ask for a motion to dismiss the charges, arguing that the government has failed to prove its case. In effect, in both kinds of cases, the lawyer asks the judge to direct a verdict for the defendant. The judge will either grant or deny the motion. If it is granted, the case is over and the defendant wins. If the motion is denied, as it usually is, the defense is given the opportunity to present its evidence patulong namn po kung ano magandang explaination dito salamat​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ever felt misjudged by a doctor? Or treated unfairly by a clinic or hospital? You may be a victim of patient profiling.
</p><p>
</p><p>Patient profiling is the practice of regarding particular patients as more likely to have certain behaviors or illnesses based on their appearance, race, gender, financial status, or other observable characteristics. Profiling disproportionately impacts patients with chronic pain, mental illness, the uninsured, and patients of color. Like racial profiling by police, patient profiling by physicians is more common than you think.
</p><p>
</p><p>We rely on doctors to first do no harm–to safeguard our health–but profiling patients often leads to improper medical care, and distrust of physicians and the health care system, with potential lifelong consequences. For the first time, people share their stories:</p><p><strong></strong></p><br />

                            22. Steps in a Trial Motion for Directed Verdict/Dismissal At the conclusion of the plaintiff's or government's evidence, the lawyer will announce that the plaintiff or government rests. Then, when the jury leaves the courtroom, the defendant's lawyer in a civil case has the option of making a motion for a directed verdict, arguing that his or her client's liability has not been proven by a preponderance of the evidence. In a criminal trial, the defendant's lawyer can ask for a motion to dismiss the charges, arguing that the government has failed to prove its case. In effect, in both kinds of cases, the lawyer asks the judge to direct a verdict for the defendant. The judge will either grant or deny the motion. If it is granted, the case is over and the defendant wins. If the motion is denied, as it usually is, the defense is given the opportunity to present its evidence patulong namn po kung ano magandang explaination dito salamat​</h2><br />
