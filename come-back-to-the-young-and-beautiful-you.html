powerful gods. The sun god, who ruled the sky, had a very beautiful daughter, Luna, the moon. Luna enjoyed 
going around the heavens in her golden chariot. One day she found herself taking another path which led 
her outside her kingdom. She wandered on until she reached the place where the sky met the sea. Beautiful 
and unusual sights greeted her eyes.
As she was admiring the beautiful things around, a voice startled her. It asked, “Where do you come 
from, most beautiful one?” Turning around she saw a young man who looked much like her father though 
fairer. She wanted to run away, but when she looked at him again, she saw that he was smiling at her. Taking 
courage she answered, “I am Luna, daughter of the sun god.” The young man smiled at her and answered, “I 
am Mar, the son of the sea god. Welcome to our kingdom.” 
Soon the two became good friends. They had many interesting stories to tell. When it was time for 
Luna to go, they promised to see each other as often as they could, for they have many more tales to tell. They 
continued meeting at the same spot until they realized that they were in love with each other. 
One day after one of their secret meetings, Luna went back to the heavens full of joy. She was so 
happy that she told her secret to one of her cousins. The cousin, jealous of her beauty and her happiness, 
reported the affair to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter’s disobedience to the immortal 
laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. 
Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar, she would rush out in the golden 
chariot to the meeting place in hopes of seeing him again. The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time 
Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. It is Mar trying to escape from his cave,” they say. </a>

                                            THE OLD FISHERMANOur house was directly across the street from the entrance of  a popular hospital in the city. We lived downstairs and rented the upstairs rooms to out patients at the clinic. One summer evening as I was fixing supper, there was a knock at the door. I opened it to see a truly awful looking man.“Why, he’s hardly taller than my eight-year-old,” I thought as I stared at the stooped, shriveled body. But the appalling thing was his face–lopsided from swelling, red and raw. Yet his voice was pleasant as he said, “Good evening. I’ve come to see if you’ve a room for just one night. I came for a treatment this morning from the eastern shore, and there’s no bus ’till the morning.”He told me he’d been hunting for a room since noon but he had no success as no one seemed to have a room. “I guess it’s my face. I know it looks terrible, but my doctor says with a few more treatments…”For a moment I hesitated, but his next words convinced me: “I could sleep in this rocking chair on the porch. My bus leaves early in the morning.” I told him we would find him a bed, but to rest on the porch.I went inside and finished getting supper. When we were ready, I asked the old man if he would join us “No thank you. I have plenty.” And he held up a brown paper bag. When I had finished the dishes, I went out on the porch to talk with him a few minutes.It didn’t take a long time to see that this old man had an oversized heart crowded into that tiny body. He told me he fished for a living to support his daughter, her five children, and her husband, who was hopelessly crippled from a back injury.He didn’t tell it by way of complaint; in fact, every other sentence was prefaced with a thanks to God for a blessing. He was grateful that no pain accompanied his disease, which was apparently a form of skin cancer. He thanked God for giving him the strength to keep going.At bedtime, we put a camp cot in the children’s room for him. When I got up in the morning, the bed linens were neatly folded and the little man was out on the porch. He refused breakfast, but just before he left for his bus, haltingly, as if asking a great favor, he said, “Could I please come back and stay the next time I have a treatment? I won’t put you out a bit. I can sleep fine in a chair.”He paused a moment and then added, “Your children made me feel at home. Grownups are bothered by my face, but children don’t seem to mind.” I told him he was welcome to come again.On his next trip he arrived a little after seven in the morning. As a gift, he brought a big fish and a quart of the largest oysters I had ever seen. He said he had shucked them that morning before he left so that they’d be nice and fresh. I knew his bus left at 4:00 a.m. and I wondered what time he had to get up in order to do this for us.In the years he came to stay overnight with us there was never a time that he did not bring us fish or oysters or vegetables from his garden. Other times we received packages in the mail, always by special delivery; fish and oysters packed in a box of fresh young spinach or kale, every leaf carefully washed.Knowing that he must walk three miles to mail these, and knowing how little money he had made the gifts more precious. When I received these little remembrances, I often thought of a comment our next-door neighbor made after he left that first morning. “Did you keep that awful looking man last night? I turned him away! You can lose roomers by putting up such people!”Maybe we did lose roomers once or twice. But oh! If only they could have known him, perhaps their illnesses would have been easier to bear. I know our family always will be grateful to have known him; from him we learned what it was to accept the bad without complaint and the good with gratitude.Recently I was visiting a friend who has a greenhouse. As she showed me her flowers, we came to the most beautiful one of all, a golden chrysanthemum, bursting with blooms. But to my great surprise, it was growing in an old dented, rusty bucket. I thought to myself, “If this were my plant, I’d put it in the loveliest container I had!” My friend changed my mind.“I ran short of pots,” she explained, “and knowing how beautiful this one would be, I thought it wouldn’t mind starting out in this old pail. It’s just for a little while, till I can put it out in the garden.”She must have wondered why I laughed so delightedly, but I was imagining just such a scene in heaven. “Here’s an especially beautiful one,” God might have said when he came to the soul of the sweet old fisherman. “He won’t mind starting in this small body.”​</a>

Two wild young geese were looking for food one day. They saw the turtle and talked with him. The next day, the geese came again to visit the turtle. They became well-acquainted and became good friends. “Friend turtle," the geese said one day, "we have a beautiful home far away. We are going to fly back to it tomorrow. Will you go with us?” "How could I? I have no wings," said the turtle. "We will take you if you keep your mouth shut. Do not say a word to anybody," they said. "I can do that. Please take me with you. I will do exactly what you say," the turtle said. So the geese brought a stick and they held the ends of it with their beaks. The geese told the turtle, “Take the middle of the stick in your mouth and don't say any word until we reach home." The children in the village saw the two geese flying with the turtle and they shouted," Oh! See the turtle up in the air. Look at the geese carrying a turtle by a stick. Did you ever see anything moreridiculous in your life?" The turtle looked down and began to say, "Well, if my friend carry me, what business is that to you? And he fell dead on the ground. As the geese flew on, they heard the people who come near the turtle say, “The fellow could not keep his mouth shut. He had talk, and so lost his life." 1. Where did the story happen? 2. Who fell into to the ground? 3. How did the geese manage to carry the turtle while flying? 4. Why did the turtle feel on the ground? 5. If you were the turtle, would you do the same? Why?

HenryPlot SummaryDella Dillingham Young has one dollar and eighty-seven cents with which to buy her beloved husband, Jim, a Christmas gift. She is dismayed at how meager the amount is, as she has spent months saving. The Dillingham Youngs are very poor, with Jim’s earnings having been reduced from thirty dollars a week to only twenty dollars. Della’s dismay leads her to throw herself upon her “shabby” couch in her cheap and worn-down apartment. She reflects that she has spent many hours fantasizing about buying Jim a nice gift, one that would show him how pleased she is to be his wife. However, with only one dollar and eighty-seven cents, she knows she will be unable to acquire a suitable present.Inspiration strikes when Della catches sight of herself in the mirror. She pulls her hair down and lets the long tresses settle around her. The Dillingham Youngs have two prized possessions: Della’s beautiful hair and Jim’s gold watch, which he received from his father. Della quickly ties her hair up again and, after shedding a few tears, leaves the apartment.Della walks to Mme. Sofronie’s Hair Goods store with a “brilliant sparkle” in her eyes. She asks if Madame Sofronie will buy her hair, to which the Madame replies that she will need to see it first. Della lets down her hair, and Madame Sofronie offers her twenty dollars for it. Requesting only that the Madame make the process “quick,” Della agrees to sell her hair. She spends the next two hours searching for the perfect gift for Jim and finally decides upon a simple but tasteful platinum watch chain. She remarks that the watch chain suits Jim perfectly, as it is understated but undeniably valuable. Once the chain is attached to Jim’s watch, he will be able to proudly show off his prized possession without being ashamed of the battered leather strap he currently uses in place of a chain. Della rushes home, elated with her purchase. She carefully curls and styles her shorn hair but is disappointed with the results, remarking that she looks like a “Coney Island chorus girl.” She begins to worry that Jim will be upset that her hair is gone. When she hears Jim approaching the apartment, she stands beside the door and prays that he will still find her attractive. Jim enters the apartment and immediately stares at Della with an inscrutable expression on his face. Della throws herself into his arms and exclaims that she has sold her hair because she “couldn’t have lived through Christmas” without buying him a worthy present. She reassures Jim that her hair grows “awfully fast” and pleads with him to “be happy.” Jim, seemingly in a daze, asks Della if she has truly cut off her hair and looks around the room almost as if in search of the lost tresses. Della nervously confirms that she has indeed sold her hair, but she reassures Jim that she is still the same person even though her hair is gone. After all, she sold her hair so that she could give Jim a nice gift.Jim, coming out of his trance, pulls Della into an embrace and reassures her that he loves her no matter what. He then pulls a package out of his coat and tells Della that she will understand his reaction when she opens it. Della eagerly opens the package and is elated to discover that it contains a pair of beautiful tortoise shell combs that she had long admired in a shop window. Her elation turns to hysteria as she realizes that her hair is gone, but she tearfully tells Jim that her hair will grow back quickly. Eager to give Jim his gift, Della rises from her seat and presents the watch chain to Jim. However, rather than taking out his watch as Della requests, Jim instead sits down on the couch and tells Della that they should put away their presents, since they are “too nice to use,” given the couple’s current circumstances. He then explains that he sold his watch in order to afford Della’s combs. The story ends with the narrator commenting on the nature of gift-giving and generosity. Though the narrator describes Della and Jim as “foolish,” he also proclaims that among those who give and receive gifts, they are the wisest.The story of the necklace and The gift of the Magi. 1.

                                            THE OLD FISHERMANOur house was directly across the street from the entrance of  a popular hospital in the city. We lived downstairs and rented the upstairs rooms to out patients at the clinic. One summer evening as I was fixing supper, there was a knock at the door. I opened it to see a truly awful looking man.“Why, he’s hardly taller than my eight-year-old,” I thought as I stared at the stooped, shriveled body. But the appalling thing was his face–lopsided from swelling, red and raw. Yet his voice was pleasant as he said, “Good evening. I’ve come to see if you’ve a room for just one night. I came for a treatment this morning from the eastern shore, and there’s no bus ’till the morning.”He told me he’d been hunting for a room since noon but he had no success as no one seemed to have a room. “I guess it’s my face. I know it looks terrible, but my doctor says with a few more treatments…”For a moment I hesitated, but his next words convinced me: “I could sleep in this rocking chair on the porch. My bus leaves early in the morning.” I told him we would find him a bed, but to rest on the porch.I went inside and finished getting supper. When we were ready, I asked the old man if he would join us “No thank you. I have plenty.” And he held up a brown paper bag. When I had finished the dishes, I went out on the porch to talk with him a few minutes.It didn’t take a long time to see that this old man had an oversized heart crowded into that tiny body. He told me he fished for a living to support his daughter, her five children, and her husband, who was hopelessly crippled from a back injury.He didn’t tell it by way of complaint; in fact, every other sentence was prefaced with a thanks to God for a blessing. He was grateful that no pain accompanied his disease, which was apparently a form of skin cancer. He thanked God for giving him the strength to keep going.At bedtime, we put a camp cot in the children’s room for him. When I got up in the morning, the bed linens were neatly folded and the little man was out on the porch. He refused breakfast, but just before he left for his bus, haltingly, as if asking a great favor, he said, “Could I please come back and stay the next time I have a treatment? I won’t put you out a bit. I can sleep fine in a chair.”He paused a moment and then added, “Your children made me feel at home. Grownups are bothered by my face, but children don’t seem to mind.” I told him he was welcome to come again.On his next trip he arrived a little after seven in the morning. As a gift, he brought a big fish and a quart of the largest oysters I had ever seen. He said he had shucked them that morning before he left so that they’d be nice and fresh. I knew his bus left at 4:00 a.m. and I wondered what time he had to get up in order to do this for us.In the years he came to stay overnight with us there was never a time that he did not bring us fish or oysters or vegetables from his garden. Other times we received packages in the mail, always by special delivery; fish and oysters packed in a box of fresh young spinach or kale, every leaf carefully washed.Knowing that he must walk three miles to mail these, and knowing how little money he had made the gifts more precious. When I received these little remembrances, I often thought of a comment our next-door neighbor made after he left that first morning. “Did you keep that awful looking man last night? I turned him away! You can lose roomers by putting up such people!”Maybe we did lose roomers once or twice. But oh! If only they could have known him, perhaps their illnesses would have been easier to bear. I know our family always will be grateful to have known him; from him we learned what it was to accept the bad without complaint and the good with gratitude.Recently I was visiting a friend who has a greenhouse. As she showed me her flowers, we came to the most beautiful one of all, a golden chrysanthemum, bursting with blooms. But to my great surprise, it was growing in an old dented, rusty bucket. I thought to myself, “If this were my plant, I’d put it in the loveliest container I had!” My friend changed my mind.“I ran short of pots,” she explained, “and knowing how beautiful this one would be, I thought it wouldn’t mind starting out in this old pail. It’s just for a little while, till I can put it out in the garden.”She must have wondered why I laughed so delightedly, but I was imagining just such a scene in heaven. “Here’s an especially beautiful one,” God might have said when he came to the soul of the sweet old fisherman. “He won’t mind starting in this small body.”​</a>

                                            Why There is High Tide during a Full Moon
Long, long ago only gods lived in this world, the earth, seas, and sky were ruled by three different powerful gods.
The sun god, who ruled the sky, had a very beautiful daughter, Luna, the moon. Luna enjoyed going around the heavens in her golden chariot. One day she found herself taking another path which led her outside her kingdom. She wandered on until she reached the place where the sky met the sea. Beautiful and unusual sights greeted her eyes. As she was admiring the beautiful things around, a voice startled her. It asked, "Where has thou come from, most beautiful one?"
Turning around she saw a young man who looked much like her father though fairer. She wanted to run away, but when she looked at him again, she saw that he was smiling at her. Taking courage she answered, "I am Luna, daughter of the sun god."
The young man smiled at her and answered, "I am Mar, the son of the sea god. Welcome to our kingdom." Soon the two became good friends. They had many interesting stories to tell each other. When it was time for Luna to go, they promised to see each other as often as they could, for they has many more tales to tell. They continued meeting at the same spot until they realized that they were in love with each other.
One day after one of their secret meetings, Luna went back to the heavens full of joy. She was so happy that she told her secret to one of her cousins. The cousin, jealous of her beauty and her happiness, reported the affair to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter's disobedience to the immortal laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. Then he sent a messenger to the sea god informing him that his son Mar disobeyed the immortal law. The sea god, who was also angered by his son's disobedience, imprisoned him in one of his sea caves.
Luna stayed in the garden for sometime. She was very sad at not being able to see Mar. She longed to be with him again. Feeling very restless one day, she escaped from the garden. She took her golden chariot and rushed to their meeting place. Mar, who was imprisoned in the sea cave, saw her reflection on the water. He wanted to get out to meet her. He tried hard to get out of his cave causing unrest in the sea. Luna waited for Mar to appear, but he did not come. Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar, she would rush out in the golden chariot to the meeting place in hopes of seeing him again.
The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. "It is Mar trying to escape from his cave," they say.

                                            The Three Brothers (Narrated by Clodualdo Garcia, an Ilocano, who was told the story by his mother when he was a small boy.) There was once an old woman who had three sons. The father died when Tito, the youngest brother, was only five years old; and the mother was left alone to bring up her three boys. The family was very poor; but the good woman worked hard, and her sons grew into sturdy young men. One day the mother called her sons before her, and said, “Now, my sons, as you see my strength is failing me, I want each of you to go into the world to seek his fortune. After nine years, come back home and show me what you have learned to do.” The three brothers consented and resolved to leave home the very next morning. Early the following day the three brothers—An-no the oldest, Berto the second, and Tito the youngest—bade their mother good-by, and set out on their travels. They followed a wide road until they came to a place where it branched in three directions. Here they stopped and consulted. It was at last agreed that An-no should take the north branch, Berto the south branch, and Tito the east branch. Before they separated, An-no proposed that at the end of the nine years they should all meet at the cross-roads before presenting themselves to their mother. Then each, wishing the others good luck, proceeded on his way. Well, to make a long story short, at the end of the nine years the three brothers met again at the place designated. Each of them told what he had learned during that time. An-no had been in the company of glassmakers, and he had learned the art of glassmaking. Berto had been employed in a shipyard, and during the nine years had become an expert boat-builder. The youngest brother, unfortunately, had fallen into the company of bad men, some notorious robbers. While he was with this band, he became the best and most skilful robber in the gang. After each had heard of the others’ fortunes, they started for their home. Their mother felt very glad to have all her sons with her once more. Shortly after this family had been re-united, the king issued a proclamation stating that his daughter, the beautiful princess Amelia, had been kidnapped by a brave stranger, and that whoever could give any information about her and restore her to the palace should be allowed to marry her. When the three brothers heard this news, they resolved to use their knowledge and skill to find the missing princess. An-no had brought home with him a spyglass in which everything hidden from the eyes of men could be seen. With this instrument, he told his brothers, he could locate the princess. He looked through his glass and saw her confined in a tower on an island. When An-no had given this information to the king, the next question was how to rescue her, “We’ll do the rest,” said the two younger brothers. Accordingly, Berto built a ship. When it was finished, the three brothers boarded her and sailed to the island where the princess was confined; but there they found the tower very closely guarded by armed soldiers, so that it seemed impossible to get into it. “Well, that is easy,” said Tito. “You stay here and wait for my return. I will bring the princess with me.” The famous young robber then went to work to steal the princess. Through his skill he succeeded in rescuing her and bringing her to the ship. Then the four sailed directly for the king’s palace. The beautiful princess was restored to her father. With great joy the king received them, and a great feast was held in the palace in honor of the rescue of his daughter. After the feast the king asked the three brothers to which of them, he should give his daughter’s hand. Each claimed the reward, and a quarrel arose among them. The king, seeing that all had played important parts in the rescue of the princess, decided not to bestow his daughter on any of them. Instead, he gave half his wealth to be divided equally among An-no, Berto, and Tito.​</a>

                                            ECHO
Echo, a beautiful mountain nymph, was a great talker and always had to have the last word. 
She was a favorite of Artemis, goddess of the hunt. Together they hunted in the woods, swam in 
mountain pools, and caught fish for meals. But Echo’s delightful life was destroyed, all because she 
tried to protect her friends from Hera’s wrath.
 One day Hera came spying on a group of nymphs in the woods. She suspected that 
her husband, Zeus, was in love with one of them and hoped to find out which one he favored.
 Echo did not know which nymph was Zeus’s favorite, and so she started a conversation with 
Hera in order to let all the other nymphs escape.” Isn’t it lovely here?” she said. “Yes, indeed,” Hera 
replied, “but I am very busy right now and have no time for talk.”
 “It seems to me you are busy talking,” said Echo, “which is the nicest way to be busy, don’t 
you agree?” She went on and on, and every time Hera tried to get away from her, Echo asked another 
question. By the time Hera got away and ran to the nymphs’ pool, all the nymphs had fled. “This is your doing,” said Hera to Echo. “You kept talking to let them escape. And I shall 
punish you for that. You shall never be able to speak first, but shall only be able to repeat what others 
say. You shall always have the last word.”
 Soon after that, Echo fell in love with a handsome young hunter named Narcissus. She 
followed him through the woods, hoping to make him notice her. But she could not speak first and 
had to wait for him to speak to her.
 One day her chance came. Narcissus became separated from his friends and called out, 
“Is anyone here?” “Here,” called Echo. Narcissus could not see her, for she was behind a bush. He 
shouted, “Come,” thinking she was one of his companions, and she called back, “Come.”
 “Let us be together,” called Narcissus, for he could not see anybody. “Let us be together,” 
called Echo, and she ran up to him with her arms open, ready to embrace him. But Narcissus said 
cruelly, “Do not touch me. I would rather perish than let you have power over me.” “Have power 
over me,” said Echo pleadingly, but Narcissus bounded away, leaving Echo alone and ashamed. 
Afterward she lived in a cave, and finally, because of her great grief, she shrank to nothing. The only 
thing left of her was her voice, which echoed through the mountains, repeating the words of anyone 
who called.

Two wild young geese were looking for food one day. They saw the turtle and talked with him. The next day, the geese came again to visit the turtle. They became well-acquainted and became good friends. “Friend turtle," the geese said one day, "we have a beautiful home far away. We are going to fly back to it tomorrow. Will you go with us?" "How could I? I have no wings," said the turtle. "We will take you if you keep your mouth shut. Do not say a word to anybody," they said. "I can do that. Please take me with you. I will do exactly what you say," the turtle said. So the geese brought a stick and they held the ends of it with their beaks. The geese told the turtle, “Take the middle of the stick in your mouth and don't say any word until we reach home." The children in the village saw the two geese flying with the turtle and they shouted," Oh! See the turtle up in the air. Look at the geese carrying a turtle by a stick. Did you ever see anything moreridiculous in your life?" The turtle looked down and began to say, "Well, if my friend carry me, what business is that to you? And he fell dead on the ground. As the geese flew on, they heard the people who come near the turtle say, "The fellow could not keep his mouth shut. He had talk, and so lost his life." 1. Where did the story happen? 2. Who fell into to the ground? 3. How did the geese manage to carry the turtle while flying? 4. Why did the turtle feel on the ground? 5. If you were the turtle, would you do the same?

powerful gods. The sun god, who ruled the sky, had a very beautiful daughter, Luna, the moon. Luna enjoyed 
going around the heavens in her golden chariot. One day she found herself taking another path which led 
her outside her kingdom. She wandered on until she reached the place where the sky met the sea. Beautiful 
and unusual sights greeted her eyes.
As she was admiring the beautiful things around, a voice startled her. It asked, “Where do you come 
from, most beautiful one?” Turning around she saw a young man who looked much like her father though 
fairer. She wanted to run away, but when she looked at him again, she saw that he was smiling at her. Taking 
courage she answered, “I am Luna, daughter of the sun god.” The young man smiled at her and answered, “I 
am Mar, the son of the sea god. Welcome to our kingdom.” 
Soon the two became good friends. They had many interesting stories to tell. When it was time for 
Luna to go, they promised to see each other as often as they could, for they have many more tales to tell. They 
continued meeting at the same spot until they realized that they were in love with each other. 
One day after one of their secret meetings, Luna went back to the heavens full of joy. She was so 
happy that she told her secret to one of her cousins. The cousin, jealous of her beauty and her happiness, 
reported the affair to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter’s disobedience to the immortal 
laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. 
Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar, she would rush out in the golden 
chariot to the meeting place in hopes of seeing him again. The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time 
Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. It is Mar trying to escape from his cave,” they say. </h2><br />

                            5. THE OLD FISHERMANOur house was directly across the street from the entrance of  a popular hospital in the city. We lived downstairs and rented the upstairs rooms to out patients at the clinic. One summer evening as I was fixing supper, there was a knock at the door. I opened it to see a truly awful looking man.“Why, he’s hardly taller than my eight-year-old,” I thought as I stared at the stooped, shriveled body. But the appalling thing was his face–lopsided from swelling, red and raw. Yet his voice was pleasant as he said, “Good evening. I’ve come to see if you’ve a room for just one night. I came for a treatment this morning from the eastern shore, and there’s no bus ’till the morning.”He told me he’d been hunting for a room since noon but he had no success as no one seemed to have a room. “I guess it’s my face. I know it looks terrible, but my doctor says with a few more treatments…”For a moment I hesitated, but his next words convinced me: “I could sleep in this rocking chair on the porch. My bus leaves early in the morning.” I told him we would find him a bed, but to rest on the porch.I went inside and finished getting supper. When we were ready, I asked the old man if he would join us “No thank you. I have plenty.” And he held up a brown paper bag. When I had finished the dishes, I went out on the porch to talk with him a few minutes.It didn’t take a long time to see that this old man had an oversized heart crowded into that tiny body. He told me he fished for a living to support his daughter, her five children, and her husband, who was hopelessly crippled from a back injury.He didn’t tell it by way of complaint; in fact, every other sentence was prefaced with a thanks to God for a blessing. He was grateful that no pain accompanied his disease, which was apparently a form of skin cancer. He thanked God for giving him the strength to keep going.At bedtime, we put a camp cot in the children’s room for him. When I got up in the morning, the bed linens were neatly folded and the little man was out on the porch. He refused breakfast, but just before he left for his bus, haltingly, as if asking a great favor, he said, “Could I please come back and stay the next time I have a treatment? I won’t put you out a bit. I can sleep fine in a chair.”He paused a moment and then added, “Your children made me feel at home. Grownups are bothered by my face, but children don’t seem to mind.” I told him he was welcome to come again.On his next trip he arrived a little after seven in the morning. As a gift, he brought a big fish and a quart of the largest oysters I had ever seen. He said he had shucked them that morning before he left so that they’d be nice and fresh. I knew his bus left at 4:00 a.m. and I wondered what time he had to get up in order to do this for us.In the years he came to stay overnight with us there was never a time that he did not bring us fish or oysters or vegetables from his garden. Other times we received packages in the mail, always by special delivery; fish and oysters packed in a box of fresh young spinach or kale, every leaf carefully washed.Knowing that he must walk three miles to mail these, and knowing how little money he had made the gifts more precious. When I received these little remembrances, I often thought of a comment our next-door neighbor made after he left that first morning. “Did you keep that awful looking man last night?

Two wild young geese were looking for food one day. They saw the turtle and talked with him. The next day, the geese came again to visit the turtle. They became well-acquainted and became good friends. “Friend turtle," the geese said one day, "we have a beautiful home far away. We are going to fly back to it tomorrow. Will you go with us?” "How could I? I have no wings," said the turtle. "We will take you if you keep your mouth shut. Do not say a word to anybody," they said. "I can do that. Please take me with you. I will do exactly what you say," the turtle said. So the geese brought a stick and they held the ends of it with their beaks. The geese told the turtle, “Take the middle of the stick in your mouth and don't say any word until we reach home." The children in the village saw the two geese flying with the turtle and they shouted," Oh! See the turtle up in the air. Look at the geese carrying a turtle by a stick. Did you ever see anything moreridiculous in your life?" The turtle looked down and began to say, "Well, if my friend carry me, what business is that to you? And he fell dead on the ground. As the geese flew on, they heard the people who come near the turtle say, “The fellow could not keep his mouth shut. He had talk, and so lost his life." 1. Where did the story happen? 2.

HenryPlot SummaryDella Dillingham Young has one dollar and eighty-seven cents with which to buy her beloved husband, Jim, a Christmas gift. She is dismayed at how meager the amount is, as she has spent months saving. The Dillingham Youngs are very poor, with Jim’s earnings having been reduced from thirty dollars a week to only twenty dollars. Della’s dismay leads her to throw herself upon her “shabby” couch in her cheap and worn-down apartment. She reflects that she has spent many hours fantasizing about buying Jim a nice gift, one that would show him how pleased she is to be his wife. However, with only one dollar and eighty-seven cents, she knows she will be unable to acquire a suitable present.Inspiration strikes when Della catches sight of herself in the mirror. She pulls her hair down and lets the long tresses settle around her. The Dillingham Youngs have two prized possessions: Della’s beautiful hair and Jim’s gold watch, which he received from his father. Della quickly ties her hair up again and, after shedding a few tears, leaves the apartment.Della walks to Mme. Sofronie’s Hair Goods store with a “brilliant sparkle” in her eyes. She asks if Madame Sofronie will buy her hair, to which the Madame replies that she will need to see it first. Della lets down her hair, and Madame Sofronie offers her twenty dollars for it. Requesting only that the Madame make the process “quick,” Della agrees to sell her hair. She spends the next two hours searching for the perfect gift for Jim and finally decides upon a simple but tasteful platinum watch chain. She remarks that the watch chain suits Jim perfectly, as it is understated but undeniably valuable. Once the chain is attached to Jim’s watch, he will be able to proudly show off his prized possession without being ashamed of the battered leather strap he currently uses in place of a chain. Della rushes home, elated with her purchase. She carefully curls and styles her shorn hair but is disappointed with the results, remarking that she looks like a “Coney Island chorus girl.” She begins to worry that Jim will be upset that her hair is gone. When she hears Jim approaching the apartment, she stands beside the door and prays that he will still find her attractive. Jim enters the apartment and immediately stares at Della with an inscrutable expression on his face. Della throws herself into his arms and exclaims that she has sold her hair because she “couldn’t have lived through Christmas” without buying him a worthy present. She reassures Jim that her hair grows “awfully fast” and pleads with him to “be happy.” Jim, seemingly in a daze, asks Della if she has truly cut off her hair and looks around the room almost as if in search of the lost tresses. Della nervously confirms that she has indeed sold her hair, but she reassures Jim that she is still the same person even though her hair is gone. After all, she sold her hair so that she could give Jim a nice gift.Jim, coming out of his trance, pulls Della into an embrace and reassures her that he loves her no matter what. He then pulls a package out of his coat and tells Della that she will understand his reaction when she opens it. Della eagerly opens the package and is elated to discover that it contains a pair of beautiful tortoise shell combs that she had long admired in a shop window. Her elation turns to hysteria as she realizes that her hair is gone, but she tearfully tells Jim that her hair will grow back quickly. Eager to give Jim his gift, Della rises from her seat and presents the watch chain to Jim. However, rather than taking out his watch as Della requests, Jim instead sits down on the couch and tells Della that they should put away their presents, since they are “too nice to use,” given the couple’s current circumstances. He then explains that he sold his watch in order to afford Della’s combs. The story ends with the narrator commenting on the nature of gift-giving and generosity. Though the narrator describes Della and Jim as “foolish,” he also proclaims that among those who give and receive gifts, they are the wisest.The story of the necklace and The gift of the Magi. 1.

                            10. THE OLD FISHERMANOur house was directly across the street from the entrance of  a popular hospital in the city. We lived downstairs and rented the upstairs rooms to out patients at the clinic. One summer evening as I was fixing supper, there was a knock at the door. I opened it to see a truly awful looking man.“Why, he’s hardly taller than my eight-year-old,” I thought as I stared at the stooped, shriveled body. But the appalling thing was his face–lopsided from swelling, red and raw. Yet his voice was pleasant as he said, “Good evening. I’ve come to see if you’ve a room for just one night. I came for a treatment this morning from the eastern shore, and there’s no bus ’till the morning.”He told me he’d been hunting for a room since noon but he had no success as no one seemed to have a room. “I guess it’s my face. I know it looks terrible, but my doctor says with a few more treatments…”For a moment I hesitated, but his next words convinced me: “I could sleep in this rocking chair on the porch. My bus leaves early in the morning.” I told him we would find him a bed, but to rest on the porch.I went inside and finished getting supper. When we were ready, I asked the old man if he would join us “No thank you. I have plenty.” And he held up a brown paper bag. When I had finished the dishes, I went out on the porch to talk with him a few minutes.It didn’t take a long time to see that this old man had an oversized heart crowded into that tiny body. He told me he fished for a living to support his daughter, her five children, and her husband, who was hopelessly crippled from a back injury.He didn’t tell it by way of complaint; in fact, every other sentence was prefaced with a thanks to God for a blessing. He was grateful that no pain accompanied his disease, which was apparently a form of skin cancer. He thanked God for giving him the strength to keep going.At bedtime, we put a camp cot in the children’s room for him. When I got up in the morning, the bed linens were neatly folded and the little man was out on the porch. He refused breakfast, but just before he left for his bus, haltingly, as if asking a great favor, he said, “Could I please come back and stay the next time I have a treatment? I won’t put you out a bit. I can sleep fine in a chair.”He paused a moment and then added, “Your children made me feel at home. Grownups are bothered by my face, but children don’t seem to mind.” I told him he was welcome to come again.On his next trip he arrived a little after seven in the morning. As a gift, he brought a big fish and a quart of the largest oysters I had ever seen. He said he had shucked them that morning before he left so that they’d be nice and fresh. I knew his bus left at 4:00 a.m. and I wondered what time he had to get up in order to do this for us.In the years he came to stay overnight with us there was never a time that he did not bring us fish or oysters or vegetables from his garden. Other times we received packages in the mail, always by special delivery; fish and oysters packed in a box of fresh young spinach or kale, every leaf carefully washed.Knowing that he must walk three miles to mail these, and knowing how little money he had made the gifts more precious. When I received these little remembrances, I often thought of a comment our next-door neighbor made after he left that first morning. “Did you keep that awful looking man last night? I turned him away! You can lose roomers by putting up such people!”Maybe we did lose roomers once or twice. But oh! If only they could have known him, perhaps their illnesses would have been easier to bear. I know our family always will be grateful to have known him; from him we learned what it was to accept the bad without complaint and the good with gratitude.Recently I was visiting a friend who has a greenhouse. As she showed me her flowers, we came to the most beautiful one of all, a golden chrysanthemum, bursting with blooms. But to my great surprise, it was growing in an old dented, rusty bucket. I thought to myself, “If this were my plant, I’d put it in the loveliest container I had!” My friend changed my mind.“I ran short of pots,” she explained, “and knowing how beautiful this one would be, I thought it wouldn’t mind starting out in this old pail. It’s just for a little while, till I can put it out in the garden.”She must have wondered why I laughed so delightedly, but I was imagining just such a scene in heaven. “Here’s an especially beautiful one,” God might have said when he came to the soul of the sweet old fisherman. “He won’t mind starting in this small body.”​</h2><br />

                            12. Why There is High Tide during a Full Moon
Long, long ago only gods lived in this world, the earth, seas, and sky were ruled by three different powerful gods.
The sun god, who ruled the sky, had a very beautiful daughter, Luna, the moon. Luna enjoyed going around the heavens in her golden chariot. One day she found herself taking another path which led her outside her kingdom. She wandered on until she reached the place where the sky met the sea. Beautiful and unusual sights greeted her eyes. As she was admiring the beautiful things around, a voice startled her. It asked, "Where has thou come from, most beautiful one?"
Turning around she saw a young man who looked much like her father though fairer. She wanted to run away, but when she looked at him again, she saw that he was smiling at her. Taking courage she answered, "I am Luna, daughter of the sun god."
The young man smiled at her and answered, "I am Mar, the son of the sea god. Welcome to our kingdom." Soon the two became good friends. They had many interesting stories to tell each other. When it was time for Luna to go, they promised to see each other as often as they could, for they has many more tales to tell. They continued meeting at the same spot until they realized that they were in love with each other.
One day after one of their secret meetings, Luna went back to the heavens full of joy. She was so happy that she told her secret to one of her cousins. The cousin, jealous of her beauty and her happiness, reported the affair to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter's disobedience to the immortal laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. Then he sent a messenger to the sea god informing him that his son Mar disobeyed the immortal law. The sea god, who was also angered by his son's disobedience, imprisoned him in one of his sea caves.
Luna stayed in the garden for sometime. She was very sad at not being able to see Mar. She longed to be with him again. Feeling very restless one day, she escaped from the garden. She took her golden chariot and rushed to their meeting place. Mar, who was imprisoned in the sea cave, saw her reflection on the water. He wanted to get out to meet her. He tried hard to get out of his cave causing unrest in the sea. Luna waited for Mar to appear, but he did not come. Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar, she would rush out in the golden chariot to the meeting place in hopes of seeing him again.
The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. "It is Mar trying to escape from his cave," they say.

                            13. The Three Brothers (Narrated by Clodualdo Garcia, an Ilocano, who was told the story by his mother when he was a small boy.) There was once an old woman who had three sons. The father died when Tito, the youngest brother, was only five years old; and the mother was left alone to bring up her three boys. The family was very poor; but the good woman worked hard, and her sons grew into sturdy young men. One day the mother called her sons before her, and said, “Now, my sons, as you see my strength is failing me, I want each of you to go into the world to seek his fortune. After nine years, come back home and show me what you have learned to do.” The three brothers consented and resolved to leave home the very next morning. Early the following day the three brothers—An-no the oldest, Berto the second, and Tito the youngest—bade their mother good-by, and set out on their travels. They followed a wide road until they came to a place where it branched in three directions. Here they stopped and consulted. It was at last agreed that An-no should take the north branch, Berto the south branch, and Tito the east branch. Before they separated, An-no proposed that at the end of the nine years they should all meet at the cross-roads before presenting themselves to their mother. Then each, wishing the others good luck, proceeded on his way. Well, to make a long story short, at the end of the nine years the three brothers met again at the place designated. Each of them told what he had learned during that time. An-no had been in the company of glassmakers, and he had learned the art of glassmaking. Berto had been employed in a shipyard, and during the nine years had become an expert boat-builder. The youngest brother, unfortunately, had fallen into the company of bad men, some notorious robbers. While he was with this band, he became the best and most skilful robber in the gang. After each had heard of the others’ fortunes, they started for their home. Their mother felt very glad to have all her sons with her once more. Shortly after this family had been re-united, the king issued a proclamation stating that his daughter, the beautiful princess Amelia, had been kidnapped by a brave stranger, and that whoever could give any information about her and restore her to the palace should be allowed to marry her. When the three brothers heard this news, they resolved to use their knowledge and skill to find the missing princess. An-no had brought home with him a spyglass in which everything hidden from the eyes of men could be seen. With this instrument, he told his brothers, he could locate the princess. He looked through his glass and saw her confined in a tower on an island. When An-no had given this information to the king, the next question was how to rescue her, “We’ll do the rest,” said the two younger brothers. Accordingly, Berto built a ship. When it was finished, the three brothers boarded her and sailed to the island where the princess was confined; but there they found the tower very closely guarded by armed soldiers, so that it seemed impossible to get into it. “Well, that is easy,” said Tito. “You stay here and wait for my return. I will bring the princess with me.” The famous young robber then went to work to steal the princess. Through his skill he succeeded in rescuing her and bringing her to the ship. Then the four sailed directly for the king’s palace. The beautiful princess was restored to her father. With great joy the king received them, and a great feast was held in the palace in honor of the rescue of his daughter. After the feast the king asked the three brothers to which of them, he should give his daughter’s hand. Each claimed the reward, and a quarrel arose among them. The king, seeing that all had played important parts in the rescue of the princess, decided not to bestow his daughter on any of them. Instead, he gave half his wealth to be divided equally among An-no, Berto, and Tito.​</h2><br />

                            14. ECHO
Echo, a beautiful mountain nymph, was a great talker and always had to have the last word. 
She was a favorite of Artemis, goddess of the hunt. Together they hunted in the woods, swam in 
mountain pools, and caught fish for meals. But Echo’s delightful life was destroyed, all because she 
tried to protect her friends from Hera’s wrath.
 One day Hera came spying on a group of nymphs in the woods. She suspected that 
her husband, Zeus, was in love with one of them and hoped to find out which one he favored.
 Echo did not know which nymph was Zeus’s favorite, and so she started a conversation with 
Hera in order to let all the other nymphs escape.” Isn’t it lovely here?” she said. “Yes, indeed,” Hera 
replied, “but I am very busy right now and have no time for talk.”
 “It seems to me you are busy talking,” said Echo, “which is the nicest way to be busy, don’t 
you agree?” She went on and on, and every time Hera tried to get away from her, Echo asked another 
question. By the time Hera got away and ran to the nymphs’ pool, all the nymphs had fled. “This is your doing,” said Hera to Echo. “You kept talking to let them escape. And I shall 
punish you for that. You shall never be able to speak first, but shall only be able to repeat what others 
say. You shall always have the last word.”
 Soon after that, Echo fell in love with a handsome young hunter named Narcissus. She 
followed him through the woods, hoping to make him notice her. But she could not speak first and 
had to wait for him to speak to her.
 One day her chance came. Narcissus became separated from his friends and called out, 
“Is anyone here?” “Here,” called Echo. Narcissus could not see her, for she was behind a bush. He 
shouted, “Come,” thinking she was one of his companions, and she called back, “Come.”
 “Let us be together,” called Narcissus, for he could not see anybody. “Let us be together,” 
called Echo, and she ran up to him with her arms open, ready to embrace him. But Narcissus said 
cruelly, “Do not touch me. I would rather perish than let you have power over me.” “Have power 
over me,” said Echo pleadingly, but Narcissus bounded away, leaving Echo alone and ashamed. 
Afterward she lived in a cave, and finally, because of her great grief, she shrank to nothing. The only 
thing left of her was her voice, which echoed through the mountains, repeating the words of anyone 
who called.
1.The ancient Greeks believed that their gods acted like ordinary people and even experienced 
human emotions. Consider Hera’s feelings and actions in the highlighted part. In what ways is she 
like a human being? (highlighted part: Hera’s wrath.One day Hera came spying on a group of nymphs in the woods. She suspected that her husband, Zeus, was in love with one of them and hoped to find out which one he favored.)
2. Based in the highlighted part, it shows how Narcissus react to Echo. How is the highlighted 
part important in the story? (highlighted part: But Narcissus said cruelly, “Do not touch me. I would rather perish than let you have power over me.”)
3.This myth tell us about unrequited love. If you were Echo how would you handle the 
situation?
4.Some myths attempt to explain how something in the world came to be. What natural 
phenomenon is explained in this myth?
5. If you could change feelings or behavior of someone to be less like Echo or Narcissus, how 
would you change him/her?</h2><br />

                            15. ASSESSMENT Read the story then answer the following questions. THE TURTLE WHO COULD NOT STOP TALKING There was a turtle in a pond at the foot of the hill. Two wild young geese were looking for food one day. They saw the turtle and talked with him. The next day, the geese came again to visit the turtle. They became well-acquainted and became good friends. “Friend turtle," the geese said one day, "we have a beautiful home far away. We are going to fly back to it tomorrow. Will you go with us?" "How could I? I have no wings," said the turtle. "We will take you if you keep your mouth shut. Do not say a word to anybody," they said. "I can do that. Please take me with you. I will do exactly what you say," the turtle said. So the geese brought a stick and they held the ends of it with their beaks. The geese told the turtle, “Take the middle of the stick in your mouth and don't say any word until we reach home." The children in the village saw the two geese flying with the turtle and they shouted," Oh! See the turtle up in the air. Look at the geese carrying a turtle by a stick. Did you ever see anything moreridiculous in your life?" The turtle looked down and began to say, "Well, if my friend carry me, what business is that to you? And he fell dead on the ground. As the geese flew on, they heard the people who come near the turtle say, "The fellow could not keep his mouth shut. He had talk, and so lost his life." 1. Where did the story happen? 2. Who fell into to the ground? 3. How did the geese manage to carry the turtle while flying? 4. Why did the turtle feel on the ground? 5. If you were the turtle, would you do the same?
