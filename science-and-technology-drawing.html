                                            Before continuing on this Module, let us have a short diagnostic test to determine your ideas regarding science and technology. For the following items, write TRUE if you feel that the statement is correct and FALSE if the statement is not.
1.Technology is the application of science.
2.Scientific theories are much less valid than scientific laws.
3.Science and technology has potentially negative societal impacts. 
4.STS is a multidisciplinary study and draws heavily on the social sciences.
5.Science mainly concerns on the acquisition and production of knowledge from the natural world.
6.Though the knowledge generated by STS is important, it has little bearing on government policy-making.
7.The study of STS is important for both the natural science community and the social science community.
8.The domain of science requires skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving but less on creativity and imagination.
9.When we try to look into how various social factors affect the development of science and how developments in science affect human society, we are delving into the STS territory.
10.STS deals mostly with historical developments of science and technology and its impact to society and less with the philosophical implications of these developments.</a>
