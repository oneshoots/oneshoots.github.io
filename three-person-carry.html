Two, it is a letter addressed to Jesus Christ who is not a common person, relative, friend, or acquaintance. Jesus, for the Christians, is the Son of Mary. And three, the letter is asking for some explanation of the untoward happenings here on planet Earth. Lastly, the letter will not be mailed but will be placed on the altar for the angels to carry to Jesus. Amazingly different in three ways, the letter holds the greatest message of all time-the message of love and justice, of brotherhood, and sisterhood. 1. Which sentence states the generalization? 2.

You have learned from the spokesperson of the labor union of the company that they plan to stage a strike against the management due to benefits and wage concerns. This is clearly a matter of conflict between the workers and the owners/management. However, there were some workers who do not wish to join because of their personal reason. With this situation, there were some department workers who do not wish to carry their usual tasks, thus affecting the efficiency of the company.With the three perspectives in mind, analyze the situation by considering the following: Level of analysis, nature of society, foundations of social interactions, focus of study, and the advantages and the disadvantages.

And three, the letter is asking for some explanation of the untoward happenings here on planet Earth. Lastly, the letter will not be mailed but will be placed on the altar for the angels to carry to Jesus. Amazingly different in three ways, the letter holds the greatest message of all time-the message of love and justice, of brotherhood, and sisterhood. 1. Which sentence states the generalization? 2.

The main function of the circulatory system is to carry oxygen and nutrients to every cell of the body and to re move carbon dioxide and other wastes from the cells. 2. A typical person has around three to six liters of blood. 3. When the heart pumps, the two atria relax, forcing blood into the ventricles. 4. Blood is carried throughout the body by a vast network of blood vessels, which resembles a series of pipelines that deliver water to households. 5. Arteries are blood vessels that move blood toward the heart. 6. Plasma is a pale yellowish liquid that is about 92 percent water. 7. Arteries and veins are connected by very small blood vessels called capillaries. 8. The white blood cells (WBC) also known as erythrocytes are colorless and do not contain hemoglobin. 9.

The types of blood vessels include arteries, capillaries and veins.</p><p></p><p>2) <strong>True</strong>... The amount of blood circulating within an individual depends on their size and weight, but the average human adult has <strong>nearly 5 liters</strong> of circulating blood.</p><p></p><p>3) <strong>True...</strong> During ventricular systole <strong>the ventricles are contracting and vigorously pulsing</strong> (or ejecting) two separated blood supplies from the heart—one to the lungs and one to all other body organs and systems—while <strong>the two atria are relaxed</strong> (atrial diastole).</p><p></p><p>4) <strong>True</strong>... <strong>The function of blood vessels is to deliver blood to the organs and tissues in your body.</strong> The blood supplies them with the oxygen and nutrients they need to function. Blood vessels also carry waste products and carbon dioxide away from your organs and tissues.</p><p></p><p>5) <strong>False</strong>... The circulatory system is made up of blood vessels that carry blood away from and towards the heart. <strong>Arteries carry blood away from the heart</strong> and veins carry blood back to the heart. The circulatory system carries oxygen, nutrients, and hormones to cells, and removes waste products, like carbon dioxide.</p><p></p><p>6) <strong>True</strong>... <strong>Plasma is a pale yellow mixture of water, proteins and salts</strong>. One of the functions of plasma is to act as a carrier for blood cells, nutrients, enzymes, and hormones. It is <strong>90–92 percent water</strong>, but it contains critical solutes necessary for sustaining health and life.</p><p></p><p>7) <strong>True</strong>... <strong>Capillaries are small, thin blood vessels that connect the arteries and the veins.</strong> Their thin walls allow oxygen, nutrients, carbon dioxide and waste products to pass to and from the tissue cells.</p><p></p><p>8) <strong>False</strong>... The most abundant formed elements in blood, <strong>erythrocytes (red blood cells) are red, biconcave disks packed with an oxygen-carrying compound called hemoglobin.</strong> The hemoglobin molecule contains four globin proteins bound to a pigment molecule called heme, which contains an ion of iron. A <strong>white blood cell, also known as a leukocyte or white corpuscle, is a cellular component of the blood that lacks hemoglobin</strong>, has a nucleus, is capable of motility, and defends the body against infection and disease. Contrary to their name, <strong>white blood cells are colorless</strong> but can appear as a very light purple to pink color when examined under a microscope and colored with dye.</p><p></p><p>9) <strong>True</strong>... The circulatory system is made up of blood vessels that carry blood away from and towards the heart. Arteries carry blood away from the heart and <strong>veins carry blood back to the heart</strong>. The circulatory system carries oxygen, nutrients, and hormones to cells, and removes waste products, like carbon dioxide. <strong>Veins are the pipes that carry deoxygenated blood and waste products around the body</strong>. As cells use the oxygen and nutrients delivered by the arteries they create waste products, such as carbon dioxide.</p><p></p><p>10) <strong>True</strong>... Red blood cells<strong>, also known as erythrocytes,</strong> deliver oxygen to the tissues in your body. Oxygen turns into energy and your tissues release carbon dioxide. Your red blood cells also transport carbon dioxide to your lungs for you to exhale.</p><br />
