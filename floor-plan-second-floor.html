                    <p>Alvin is planning to lay out new tiles on the second floor of his house. The floor area is 25 square meters. He plans to use a 40 cm by 40 cm tile. Estimate how many pieces of tiles he needs to buy. Note: 100cm = 1m.
What do you think are the length and width of the floor where the tiles will be placed? What made you think that these are the dimensions?
How many 40cm by 40cm tiles can be placed on the side of the floor? How did you figure this out? 
How many pieces of tiles does Alvin need to buy? How did you find this value?
If he plans to use the same tile size on the first floor and the floor area of the first floor is 30 square meters, how many pieces of tiles does he need to buy?</p>

role in consumer protection. A consumer has rights
mandated by law. These are privileges that an
individual is guaranteed of health products and
services. The Republic Act No. 7394 also known
as Consumer Act of the Philippines is a law that
protects the interest of the consumer, promotes the
general welfare, and establishes standards of
conduct for business and industry. There are eight
basic rights of a consumer according to the Act
(Banzon, et al. 2005).

Module

In the previous module, you have learned
about the complementary and alternative
healthcare modalities. The government also plays an important
role in consumer protection. A consumer has rights
mandated by law. These are privileges that an
individual is guaranteed of health products and
services. The Republic Act No. 7394 also known
as Consumer Act of the Philippines is a law that
protects the interest of the consumer, promotes the
general welfare, and establishes standards of
conduct for business and industry. There are eight
basic rights of a consumer according to the Act
(Banzon, et al. 2005).
