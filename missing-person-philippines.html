The bulk of these early literature however was just passed on through oral recitation and Incantation and were transcribed into the Roman alphabet only centuries later by Spanish chroniclers and other scholars.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Filipino food</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I think the selection you're referring to is the story, "Where's the patis?"
</p><p>
</p><p>In the last part of the selection, the person speaking misses Filipino foods the most. He mentioned Pinoy foods like sinigang and tapa along the way when in fact he was offered with luxurious food from an expensive European restaurant.
</p><p>
</p><p>One of the important highlights in the selection as well is when the speaker actually looks for patis or fish sauce which I think is very Filipino. We always have patis in every meal we have and it feels incomplete if we don't have it in our food table.

What do you think "the pinoy" in the selection will chose to eat with his kababayan rather than in an expensive restauran?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>In the selection, Where's the Patis, some of the countries the author mentioned were <strong>Hong Kong, Tokyo, London, Paris.
</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Some international food mentioned were:  </strong></p>Scotland's pink salmon
Golden English Herring
France's anchovies
Belgium's green salad
Italy's pasta
Russia's caviar on ice
<p>
</p><p>I think the Filipino in the story misses Filipino food so much because even though he was in a high-end European restaurant, he kept on comparing these food to Filipino dishes like sinigang, tapa, etc.
</p><p>
</p><p>I think the Pinoy would eat with his kababayan, totally. Because he misses his homeland so bad and what could ease that is eating with a fellow kababayan or I think at least eat somewhere with Filipino dishes because as he mentioned, no matter how much he tried it is the Filipino food that cannot be replaced no matter where he goes.
