                                            Sexual Reproduction In HumansHumans (and all animals that reproduce sexually) have cells called gametes, Gametes are formed during meloals and come in the form of sperm (produced by males) or eggs (produced by females). When conditions are right, sperm and egg unite in a procese known as fertilization. The resulting fertilized egg, or zygote, contains genes from both parents. Questions to Ponder: Write your answers on a separate sheet of paper. 1. How many parent cell/s is/are Involved in sexual reproduction? 2. Are the parents and the offspring identical or not? Explain your answer. 3. How are asexual and sexual reproductions almllar? How do they differ? 4. Draw your own conclusion,​</a>

Your journey begins in the capillaries of the lungs, and you just pick up your first load of oxygen. Be sure to name the cells in the lungs that drop off oxygen. Also, name the cells in the blood that pick up the oxygen. Describe where the cells of the blood travel to drop off oxygen. Then describe where these cells of the blood travel to drop off oxygen they have picked up and what they pick up in return. Be sure to give the name for this process. Continue your story by explaining where this new cargo must be dropped off and why. Then, pretend the human body you are inside begins to exercise and energy demand is increased. Explain how your movements change as you try to help maintain homeostasis or balance.

                            14. Sexual Reproduction In HumansHumans (and all animals that reproduce sexually) have cells called gametes, Gametes are formed during meloals and come in the form of sperm (produced by males) or eggs (produced by females). When conditions are right, sperm and egg unite in a procese known as fertilization. The resulting fertilized egg, or zygote, contains genes from both parents. Questions to Ponder: Write your answers on a separate sheet of paper. 1. How many parent cell/s is/are Involved in sexual reproduction? 2. Are the parents and the offspring identical or not? Explain your answer. 3. How are asexual and sexual reproductions almllar? How do they differ? 4. Draw your own conclusion,​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Sexual reproduction requires two parents. Each parent contributes a gamete - a sex cell that has half of the normal DNA of a regular body cell. In males, the gametes are sperm and in females, the gametes are eggs.</p><p></p><p>2. In asexual reproduction all the genes in the offspring come from one parent. In sexual reproduction one full set of the genes come from each parent. Living things produce offspring of the same species, but in many cases offspring are not identical with each other or with their parents.</p><p></p><p>3. Asexual reproduction does not involve sex cells or fertilisation . Only one parent is required, unlike sexual reproduction which needs two parents. ... As a result, the offspring are genetically identical to the parent and to each other. They are clones.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps</p><p></p><br />

Also, name the cells in the blood that pick up the oxygen. Describe where the cells of the blood travel to drop off oxygen. Then describe where these cells of the blood travel to drop off oxygen they have picked up and what they pick up in return. Be sure to give the name for this process. Continue your story by explaining where this new cargo must be dropped off and why. Then, pretend the human body you are inside begins to exercise and energy demand is increased. Explain how your movements change as you try to help maintain homeostasis or balance.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Having now learned about the male and reproductive systems, compare and contrast the two.</p> <strong>In what ways are they similar?</strong> They are the same in that <strong>most of the reproductive organs of both sexes develop from similar embryonic tissue, meaning they are homologous. </strong>Both systems have gonads that produce (sperm and egg or ovum) and sex organs.<strong>Different?</strong>The male has reproductive organs, or genitals, that are both inside and outside the pelvis, while the female has reproductive organs entirely within the pelvis.<p></p><p>2. How do the male and female reproductive systems work with each other for human reproduction?</p><strong>The male gamete, or sperm, and the female gamete, the egg or ovum, meet in the female's reproductive system.</strong> When sperm fertilizes (meets) an egg, this fertilized egg is called a zygote (pronounced: ZYE-goat). The zygote goes through a process of becoming an embryo and developing into a fetus.<p></p><p>3. Differentiate the egg cell from the sperm cell by researching further.</p>Sperm and ovum are the gametes produced by vertebrates. More specifically, <strong>sperm is the male gamete while the ovum is the female gamete.</strong> These two cells also have contrasting size – for instance, the sperm is the smallest cell in the human body while the ovum is the largest.<p></p><p>4.Males have testosterone while females have estrogen and progesterone,Compare the functions of the three hormones.</p><p></p>it's just that women have more estrogen while men have more testosterone. Testosterone is an androgen, which is a “male” sex hormone that plays a role in reproduction, growth, and maintenance of a healthy body. In men, testosterone is mainly produced in the testes.The main reproductive hormones estrogen, testosterone, and progesterone are instrumental in sexuality and fertility. They are responsible for pregnancy, puberty, mensuration, menopause, sex drive, sperm production and more. These hormones are produced in the ovaries (in females) and testes (in males).<p></p><p>5.Describe/draw the journey that the sperm cells go through to exit the male body. Include the parts of the male reproductive system that sperm cells need to pass through.</p>The correct sequence for transport of sperm cells in male reproductive system is Seminiferous tubules → <strong>Rete testis → Vasa efferentia → Epididymis Vas deferens → Ejaculatory duct → Urethra → Urethral meatus.O</strong>Sperm cells pass through a series of ducts to reach the outside of the body. After they leave the testes, the sperm passes through the <strong>epididymis, ductus deferens, ejaculatory duct, and urethra.</strong><p></p><p>6.Describe/draw the journey that the mature egg cell goes through while waiting for fertilization. Include the parts of the female reproductive system that it passes through.</p>The ovaries produce the egg cells, called the ova or oocytes. The oocytes are then transported to the fallopian tube where fertilization by a sperm may occur. The fertilized egg then moves to the uterus, where the uterine lining has thickened in response to the normal hormones of the reproductive cycleA female's internal reproductive organs are the <strong>vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries.</strong> The vagina is a muscular, hollow tube that extends from the vaginal opening to the uterus.<p></p><p>7.How are the structures of the following organs important to the jobs they do? </p>a. Penis-the penis' structure enables itto as a tube from where urine and sperm can exit, and it's erectile and ejaculatory function enable it to server its purpose in sexual reproduction.b. <strong>Testes</strong><strong> </strong>- the testes are inside the scrotum in order to protect sperm cells, and also to maintain testicular temperature for spermatogenesis.c. <strong>Scrotum </strong>- the scrotum being outsidethe body enables it to maintain a temperature lower than core body temperature for maintenance of sperm.d. <strong>Ovaries</strong> - the ovaries being located at either side of the uterus enables egg cells to easily travel to the uterus.e. <strong>Fallopian tubes</strong> - These tubes attach the ovaries to the uterus, and the vagina, enables it to house and support an egg cell or a fetus.f. <strong>Uterus</strong> - being pear-shape and near other parts like the ovaries and the vagina, enables it to house and support and egg cell or a fetus.g. <strong>Vagina</strong> - it connects the uterusand cervix to the outside of the body, allowing for menstruation, reproduction,and childbirth.<p></p><p></p><p>hope it helps, pabrainliest po.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>study well.</p><br />
