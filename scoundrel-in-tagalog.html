Eager to rest his feet, the wanderer hailed the countryman, who seemed happy enough to straighten his back and talk for a moment. "What sort of people live in the next town?" asked the stranger. "What were the people like where you've come from?" replied the farmer, answering the question with another question. "They were a bad lot. Troublemakers all, and lazy too.

The Farmer &amp; the Snake
A Farmer walked through his field one cold winter morning. On the ground lay a Snake, 
stiff and frozen with the cold. The Farmer knew how deadly the Snake could be, and yet he 
picked it up and put it in his bosom to warm it back to life.
The Snake soon revived, and when it had enough strength, bit the man who had been so 
kind to it. The bite was deadly and the Farmer felt that he must die. As he drew his last breath, 
he said to those standing around: Learn from my fate not to take pity on a scoundrel.</a>
