                        <p><strong>Velocity at the highest point = </strong><strong>0 m/s²
</strong></p><p><strong>Velocity when it is returned to the elevation from where it was thrown = </strong><strong>10 m/s²</strong></p><p><strong>Acceleration at the highest point = </strong><strong>0 m / s²
</strong></p><p><strong>Acceleration just before it hits the ground = </strong><strong>9.8 m / s²</strong></p><p><strong>Acceleration of the ball after 1 second = </strong><strong>-9.8 m / s²
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p>Further explanation
<p>The motion of the ball being thrown is included in <strong>uniformly accelerated motion with constant acceleration</strong>. Its acceleration is influenced by Earth's gravity of g (g = 9.8 m / s²)
</p><p>Equation used
</p><p>[tex]\rm \boxed{\bold{vt=vo+gt}}[/tex]</p><p>[tex]\rm \boxed{\bold{h=vo.t+\dfrac{1}{2}gt^2}}[/tex]</p><p><strong>g is negative</strong> if the motion goes up (vertical upward motion)
</p><p><strong>g is positive </strong>if the motion goes down (free fall motion)
</p><p>
</p><p>Maria throws a ball straight up with an initial velocity of 10 m / s.
</p><p>
</p><strong>What is its velocity at the highest point?
</strong><p>The motion of the ball is thrown vertically upward (in the y axis direction) with an initial velocity vo will continue to decrease because it is slowed by the gravity of the earth so that the speed of the ball will be equal to zero when reaching a maximum height and at that time the right ball will start to reverse toward the ground again
</p><p>So <strong>the velocity of the ball at the highest point is 0
</strong></p><p>
</p><strong>What is its velocity when it is returned to the elevation from where it was thrown?
</strong><p>We can use the law of conservation of mechanical energy at the starting point of throwing and the end point when the ball drops
</p><p>[tex]\rm \boxed{\bold {PE1+KE1= PE2+KE2}}[/tex]</p><p>[tex]\rm mgh1+\dfrac{1}{2}mv1^2=mgh2+\dfrac{1}{2}mv2^2[/tex]</p><p>From this equation shows that the same value is <strong>the height of the ball (h), mass (m) and g (acceleration due to gravity</strong>), so that the equation becomes
</p><p>[tex]\rm \dfrac{1}{2}mv1^2=\dfrac{1}{2}mv2^2[/tex]</p><p>so that
</p>v1 = v2
<p>because v1 = 10 m / s², then <strong>v2 = 10 m / s²
</strong></p><p>
</p><strong>What is its acceleration at the highest point?
</strong><p>Because the speed is v = 0, the acceleration is also = 0  m/s²</p><strong>What is its acceleration just before it hits the ground?
</strong><p>Constant ball acceleration is influenced by acceleration of gravity = <strong>+9.8 m / s²</strong></p><strong>After 1 second, what is the acceleration of the ball?
</strong><p>Ball motion has a constant acceleration that is the same as the acceleration of gravity, but because of its upward direction the value is negative =<strong> -9.8 m / s²

                        <strong>Zero
</strong><strong>This happens because regardless of mass, the acceleration due to gravity is constant at 9.81 meters per second per second (9.81 m/s^2) or 32 feet per second per second (32 ft/s^2). As a result, for every second an object experiences free fall, gravity will accelerate it so its velocity increases 9.81 m/s or 32 ft/s.</strong><strong>Zero</strong><strong>I don't know the answer :c</strong><strong>C</strong><p></p><p>Hope it helps :T</p><p>Please correct me if I'm wrong :L</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>9. At a projectile's highest point, its velocity is zero. At a projectile's highest point, its acceleration is zero.</p><p></p><p>10. At a projectile's highest point, its acceleration is zero</p><p></p><p>11.So the acceleration of the projectile is equal to the acceleration due to gravity, 9.81 meters/second/second, from just after its thrown, through its highest point, and until just before it hits the ground.</p><p></p><p>12. At its highest point, the vertical velocity is zero. As the object falls toward Earth again, the vertical velocity increases again in magnitude but points in the opposite direction to the initial vertical velocity.</p><br />
