Borrow for the right reasons.  2. Borrow only for what you need.  3. Know how much you can afford to pay.  4. Choose the right loan facility.  5. Monitor your cash flow, specially your spending. ​ANSWERBorrow for the right reasons.When you borrow money, you should use it to buy an asset that increases value over time and has a potential to make your money — this is what he calls the good debt.Borrow only what you need.If you need P200,000 to start a business, then borrow only that amount, even if you’re eligible for a loan with a higher amount.Remember that the bigger the amount you borrow, then the more interests fees you pay, the larger your monthly payments are, and the longer you most likely have to pay.Know how much you can afford to pay.Check your budget and see how much you can actually afford to pay every month. According to him, you should never assume you’ll have more money in the future, and just work within your current income.Choose the right loan facility.Banks and most financial institutions can definitely offer much lower rates. And when it comes to borrowing money, getting the lowest interest rate should be your priority.Monitor your cashflow, especially your spending.After getting the money, keeping track of your spending should now be your priority. Be sure that you’re not splurging your borrowed cash on unnecessary or unplanned purchases. Another thing, make sure to always pay on time to avoid extra charges.</a>

below. Then, write at least 2-3 sentences as an explanation to support your answer.
1. Solo travel will not only reveal colorful new heights, but it will also introduce you to yourself - your resiliency, your sense of adventure, and your independence. Learning how to travel solo is as intrinsic as tying your shoes, and it is something that can be learned today. The first, most obvious, way to travel solo successfully is to research your area. The number one indicator of a tourist is someone stopped in the middle of the sidewalk scanning the
GPS on their phone. According to World Travel News Report, four in fifteen tourists will be pickpocketed if they standstill on a busy street (Parker, 2019). Arrive well-informed on the area. Understand the public transportation system to the point where you can blend in as a local. Also, in line with safety, you may want to splurge on accommodations. You can stay alone in a hostel but read the reviews carefully. Make sure it is in a safe area and security is a priority for them. You might even want to consider a private room, some of which include a private bath. In terms of fun, pack for your lack of companionship. Bring a blank journal to record your
adventures. Pack a paperback to enjoy while you wait out a rainstorm in a coffee shop. World traveler Samantha Byrnes says, “I never travel with friends. When I’m exploring a new continent, my journal is my only sidekick” (Byrnes, 2018). This allows her to absorb her new surroundings, make new acquaintances, and focus on the act of encountering herself. Byrnes continues, “We lost sight of ourselves in the day-to-day. We
focus on work, family, to-do lists, and chores. Solo travel allows us to return to ourselves so that, when we resume our day-to-day activities, we can give our all” (Byrnes, 2018). Learning how to travel solo successfully is an achievable feat. You can stay safe if you remain knowledgeable about the area and choose your accommodations wisely. Beyond that, you can experience true transformation through the simple act of carrying a tattered old journal. What
do you say? Will you explore solo travel? Choose wisely, for it just might change your life forever.
3. The definition of climate states that the word “climate’ is used to refer to long-term periodic variations in the weather patterns that are observed over centuries. Ever since the Earth was created, it is going through many changes simultaneously, and this leads to climate change. Climate change happens cyclically, it started from a colder ice age, and at the very present,
it is much warmer than it was two million years ago. All these millions of life forms we see today on Earth are because of the non-stop energy received from the Sun, which is the ultimate source of energy, and is continuously fueling the weather system. To jot down a few notable changes, the world is experiencing arbitrary droughts, unexpected weather patterns, and sudden rainfall and snowfall, there is a constant fluctuation in the temperatures leading to disasters like a forest fire, and the weather is no longer predictable enough. The changes are random, and it is getting stressful day by day even to keep track of the changes occurring. These changes have drastically influenced human lives in both positive and negative ways.</a>

Borrow for the right reasons.  2. Borrow only for what you need.  3. Know how much you can afford to pay.  4. Choose the right loan facility.  5. Monitor your cash flow, specially your spending. ​ANSWERBorrow for the right reasons.When you borrow money, you should use it to buy an asset that increases value over time and has a potential to make your money — this is what he calls the good debt.Borrow only what you need.If you need P200,000 to start a business, then borrow only that amount, even if you’re eligible for a loan with a higher amount.Remember that the bigger the amount you borrow, then the more interests fees you pay, the larger your monthly payments are, and the longer you most likely have to pay.Know how much you can afford to pay.Check your budget and see how much you can actually afford to pay every month. According to him, you should never assume you’ll have more money in the future, and just work within your current income.Choose the right loan facility.Banks and most financial institutions can definitely offer much lower rates. And when it comes to borrowing money, getting the lowest interest rate should be your priority.Monitor your cashflow, especially your spending.After getting the money, keeping track of your spending should now be your priority. Be sure that you’re not splurging your borrowed cash on unnecessary or unplanned purchases. Another thing, make sure to always pay on time to avoid extra charges.</h2><br />

                            13. Identify the writing techniques used in the following informative essays
below. Then, write at least 2-3 sentences as an explanation to support your answer.
1. Solo travel will not only reveal colorful new heights, but it will also introduce you to yourself - your resiliency, your sense of adventure, and your independence. Learning how to travel solo is as intrinsic as tying your shoes, and it is something that can be learned today. The first, most obvious, way to travel solo successfully is to research your area. The number one indicator of a tourist is someone stopped in the middle of the sidewalk scanning the
GPS on their phone. According to World Travel News Report, four in fifteen tourists will be pickpocketed if they standstill on a busy street (Parker, 2019). Arrive well-informed on the area. Understand the public transportation system to the point where you can blend in as a local. Also, in line with safety, you may want to splurge on accommodations. You can stay alone in a hostel but read the reviews carefully. Make sure it is in a safe area and security is a priority for them. You might even want to consider a private room, some of which include a private bath. In terms of fun, pack for your lack of companionship. Bring a blank journal to record your
adventures. Pack a paperback to enjoy while you wait out a rainstorm in a coffee shop. World traveler Samantha Byrnes says, “I never travel with friends. When I’m exploring a new continent, my journal is my only sidekick” (Byrnes, 2018). This allows her to absorb her new surroundings, make new acquaintances, and focus on the act of encountering herself. Byrnes continues, “We lost sight of ourselves in the day-to-day. We
focus on work, family, to-do lists, and chores. Solo travel allows us to return to ourselves so that, when we resume our day-to-day activities, we can give our all” (Byrnes, 2018). Learning how to travel solo successfully is an achievable feat. You can stay safe if you remain knowledgeable about the area and choose your accommodations wisely. Beyond that, you can experience true transformation through the simple act of carrying a tattered old journal. What
do you say? Will you explore solo travel? Choose wisely, for it just might change your life forever.
3. The definition of climate states that the word “climate’ is used to refer to long-term periodic variations in the weather patterns that are observed over centuries. Ever since the Earth was created, it is going through many changes simultaneously, and this leads to climate change. Climate change happens cyclically, it started from a colder ice age, and at the very present,
it is much warmer than it was two million years ago. All these millions of life forms we see today on Earth are because of the non-stop energy received from the Sun, which is the ultimate source of energy, and is continuously fueling the weather system. To jot down a few notable changes, the world is experiencing arbitrary droughts, unexpected weather patterns, and sudden rainfall and snowfall, there is a constant fluctuation in the temperatures leading to disasters like a forest fire, and the weather is no longer predictable enough. The changes are random, and it is getting stressful day by day even to keep track of the changes occurring. These changes have drastically influenced human lives in both positive and negative ways.</h2><br />
