                                            Direction: In each paragraph below, write the topic sentence in your answer sheet.
1. The best trip my family ever took was to Tagaytay. We drove there in 4 hours. I didn’t think it would be very interesting, but I was wrong. We stayed in Tagaytay Highlands. We rode the cable car, and visited a mini zoo where there was a parrot who stole mom’s earring! I liked the climate best, because it was cool unlike the usual warm climate we have in Pampanga. 
2. No one likes to eat with a dirty knife, fork, or spoon. It is important to completely wash all utensils before using them. Clean utensils won’t transmit germs and bacteria. They also are more pleasant to eat with. 
3. Many people think poetry is old-fashioned and uninteresting. They don’t realize that every time they hear a song sung, they are hearing poetry in the form of song lyrics. Just like many written poems, many song lyrics use rhythm, rhyme, and literary imagery. It turns out that poetry isn’t old-fashioned; it’s as modern as the latest hit song!
4. Growing a garden can be fun, can allow a person to have good exercise, and can provide fresh fruits and vegetables for the gardener. It is interesting to watch the seeds pop their heads above the soil for the first time. It is sometimes hard to believe that a little seed can become a large vine or plant in just a few weeks. Planting the seeds and pulling weeds are good exercise for anyone. Then, after watching the plant grow and produce, the gardener ends up with delicious tomatoes, beans, or other yummy produce from the garden.
5. Sometimes it is hard to fall asleep. Maybe you are not sleepy, or maybe you are thinking about what happened during the day. You can also lie awake if a big event, like a test or a party, is happening the next day. There are several things you can do to try and fall asleep. You can try counting sheep, or just counting, which will keep your mind busy with a repetitious activity. Sometimes listening to soft music or gentle sounds, like rain, helps. You can even try telling yourself a story, which may distract your mind enough that you will be able to sleep in no time.</a>

                                            Musical composition, music composition or simply composition, can refer to an original piece or work of music,[1] either vocal or instrumental, the structure of a musical piece or to the process of creating or writing a new piece of music. People who create new compositions are called composers. Composers of primarily songs are usually called songwriters;[2][3] with songs, the person who writes lyrics for a song is the lyricist. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music "score," which is then performed by the composer or by other musicians. In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression. In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all and instead compose the song in their mind and then play, sing or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music.
Although a musical composition often uses musical notation and has a single author, this is not always the case. A work of music can have multiple composers, which often occurs in popular music when all members of a band collaborate to write a song or in musical theatre, when one person writes the melodies, a second person writes the lyrics and a third person orchestrates the songs.
A piece of music can also be composed with words, images or, since the 20th century, with computer programs that explain or notate how the singer or musician should create musical sounds. Examples range from 20th century avant-garde music that uses graphic notation, to text compositions such as Karlheinz Stockhausen's Aus den sieben Tagen, to computer programs that select sounds for musical pieces. Music that makes heavy use of randomness and chance is called aleatoric music and is associated with contemporary composers active in the 20th century, such as John Cage, Morton Feldman and Witold Lutosławski. A more commonly known example of chance-based, or indeterminate, music is the sound of wind chimes jingling in a breeze. The study of composition has traditionally been dominated by examination of methods and practice of Western classical music, but the definition of composition is broad enough to include the creation of popular music and traditional music songs and instrumental pieces, and to include spontaneously improvised works like those of free jazz performers and African percussionists such as Ewe drummers.
In the 2000s, composition is considered to consist of the manipulation of each aspect of music (harmony, melody, form, rhythm and timbre), according to Jean-Benjamin de Laborde (1780, 2:12):
Composition consists in two things only. The first is the ordering and disposing of several sounds...in such a manner that their succession pleases the ear. This is what the Ancients called melody. The second is the rendering audible of two or more simultaneous sounds in such a manner that their combination is pleasant. This is what we call harmony and it alone merits the name of composition.

                            10. Direction: In each paragraph below, write the topic sentence in your answer sheet.
1. The best trip my family ever took was to Tagaytay. We drove there in 4 hours. I didn’t think it would be very interesting, but I was wrong. We stayed in Tagaytay Highlands. We rode the cable car, and visited a mini zoo where there was a parrot who stole mom’s earring! I liked the climate best, because it was cool unlike the usual warm climate we have in Pampanga. 
2. No one likes to eat with a dirty knife, fork, or spoon. It is important to completely wash all utensils before using them. Clean utensils won’t transmit germs and bacteria. They also are more pleasant to eat with. 
3. Many people think poetry is old-fashioned and uninteresting. They don’t realize that every time they hear a song sung, they are hearing poetry in the form of song lyrics. Just like many written poems, many song lyrics use rhythm, rhyme, and literary imagery. It turns out that poetry isn’t old-fashioned; it’s as modern as the latest hit song!
4. Growing a garden can be fun, can allow a person to have good exercise, and can provide fresh fruits and vegetables for the gardener. It is interesting to watch the seeds pop their heads above the soil for the first time. It is sometimes hard to believe that a little seed can become a large vine or plant in just a few weeks. Planting the seeds and pulling weeds are good exercise for anyone. Then, after watching the plant grow and produce, the gardener ends up with delicious tomatoes, beans, or other yummy produce from the garden.
5. Sometimes it is hard to fall asleep. Maybe you are not sleepy, or maybe you are thinking about what happened during the day. You can also lie awake if a big event, like a test or a party, is happening the next day. There are several things you can do to try and fall asleep. You can try counting sheep, or just counting, which will keep your mind busy with a repetitious activity. Sometimes listening to soft music or gentle sounds, like rain, helps. You can even try telling yourself a story, which may distract your mind enough that you will be able to sleep in no time.</h2><br />

                            14. B. In each paragraph below, underline the key sentence and encircle at least one supporting sentence.1. The best trip my family ever took was to New Orleans, Louisiana. We drove there in two days. I didn'tthink it would be very interesting, but I was wrong. We saw the Mississippi River, rode a horse carriage inthe French Quarter, and visited a cemetery where everyone was buried above the ground. I liked the foodbest, especially the New Orleans doughnuts called beignets.2. No one likes to eat with a dirty knife, fork, or spoon. It is important to completely wash all utensilsbefore using them. Clean utensils won't transmit germs and bacteria. They also are more pleasant to eatwith.3. Many people think poetry is old-fashioned and uninteresting. They don't realize that every time theyhear a song sung, they are hearing poetry in the form of song lyrics. Just like many written poems, manysong lyrics use rhythm, rhyme, and literary imagery. It turns out that poetry isn't old-fashioned; it's asmodern as the latest hit song.4. Growing a garden can be fun, good exercise, and will provide fresh fruits and vegetables for thegardener. It is interesting to watch the seeds pop their heads above the soil for the first time. It issometimes hard to believe that a little seed can become a large vine or plant in just a few weeks. Plantingthe seeds and pulling weeds are good exercise for anyone. Then, after watching the plant grow andproduce, the gardener ends up with delicious tomatoes, beans, or other yummy produce from the garden.5. Sometimes it is hard to fall asleep. Maybe you are not sleepy, or maybe you are thinking about whathappened during the day. You can also lie awake if a big event, like a test or a party, is happening thenext day. There are several things you can do to try and fall asleep. You can try counting sheep, or justcounting, which will keep your mind busy with a repetitious activity. Sometimes listening to soft music ogentle sounds, like rain, helps. You can even try telling yourself a story, which may distract your mindenough that you will be asleep in no time. ​</h2><br />

                            16. Musical composition, music composition or simply composition, can refer to an original piece or work of music,[1] either vocal or instrumental, the structure of a musical piece or to the process of creating or writing a new piece of music. People who create new compositions are called composers. Composers of primarily songs are usually called songwriters;[2][3] with songs, the person who writes lyrics for a song is the lyricist. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music "score," which is then performed by the composer or by other musicians. In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression. In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all and instead compose the song in their mind and then play, sing or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music.
Although a musical composition often uses musical notation and has a single author, this is not always the case. A work of music can have multiple composers, which often occurs in popular music when all members of a band collaborate to write a song or in musical theatre, when one person writes the melodies, a second person writes the lyrics and a third person orchestrates the songs.
A piece of music can also be composed with words, images or, since the 20th century, with computer programs that explain or notate how the singer or musician should create musical sounds. Examples range from 20th century avant-garde music that uses graphic notation, to text compositions such as Karlheinz Stockhausen's Aus den sieben Tagen, to computer programs that select sounds for musical pieces. Music that makes heavy use of randomness and chance is called aleatoric music and is associated with contemporary composers active in the 20th century, such as John Cage, Morton Feldman and Witold Lutosławski. A more commonly known example of chance-based, or indeterminate, music is the sound of wind chimes jingling in a breeze. The study of composition has traditionally been dominated by examination of methods and practice of Western classical music, but the definition of composition is broad enough to include the creation of popular music and traditional music songs and instrumental pieces, and to include spontaneously improvised works like those of free jazz performers and African percussionists such as Ewe drummers.
In the 2000s, composition is considered to consist of the manipulation of each aspect of music (harmony, melody, form, rhythm and timbre), according to Jean-Benjamin de Laborde (1780, 2:12):
Composition consists in two things only. The first is the ordering and disposing of several sounds...in such a manner that their succession pleases the ear. This is what the Ancients called melody. The second is the rendering audible of two or more simultaneous sounds in such a manner that their combination is pleasant. This is what we call harmony and it alone merits the name of composition.
