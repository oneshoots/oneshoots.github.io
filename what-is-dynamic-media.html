                                            what is the main idea below.
- Many learners and teachers have established a wide range of
activities to support approaches to creativity and exploit the features of digital
technologies in processes such as: (a)developing ideas: supporting imaginative
conjecture, exploration and representation of ideas; (b) making connections:
supporting, challenging, informing and developing ideas by making
connections within formation, people, projects and resources; (c) creating and
making: engaging in making meanings though fashioning processes of
capture, manipulation and transformation of media; (d) collaboration:
working with others in immediate and dynamic ways to collaborate on
outcomes and construct shared knowledge; (e) communication and
evaluation: publishing and communicating outcomes for evaluation and
critique from a range of audiences. These activities are not always discrete or
sequential and there can be synchronicity in their expression and overlap of
applications for different purposes. Examples of such activities range from
using simulations and adventure games to explore the question ‘what would
happen if…?’, to publishing hypertext stories or constructing avatars to meet
and interact in three-dimensional, virtual worlds. This wealth of activity
illustrates how children and young people are able to use ICT to demonstrate
creative characteristics in the interaction between people and processes in
subject areas which are authentic, relevant and challenging</a>

What did you feel after reading the story? "As a university professor, the challenges of moving to virtual classes were not far behind. Even though I had just received a certification in virtual distance education. During this semester, I found myself teaching a course on contemporary models of psychotherapy. Two weeks after the quarantine began, the unit I would teach on would be expressive therapies. I was thinking how to translate a dynamic application in the classroom into a virtual activity. At that moment it occurred to me, rather than giving a class, my students needed that space to process the new reality of COVID-19. So, not only did I give a virtual class on expressive therapies, I converted the space into an art therapy live application as well. The goal was that each of them from their homes could express themselves from their homes through four drawings, allowing creativity to flow and emphasizing the process, not the result. By discussing the theories, they analyzed their arts meaning, which in turn promoted laughter and participation among them. Also, the group discussions allowed them to find new meanings, named their concerns and see the positive side of it all. But more importantly, it 15​</a>

                                            What I Have Learned 1. The artworks and styles of the past have evolved and have adapted to a dynamic changing world, a world immersed in the latest technology and emerging ideologies to become the Contemporary Art of today. 2 Contemporary Art refers to art of any form and genre that produced in our contemporary time, simply put as "art created today." 3. Genres are categories of artistic creation and are characterized by similarities in form, style, or subject matter. 4. Contemporary Art is expressions of the artist's thoughts and feelings based on their experience of the here and now which current events, issues and social concerns affecting the society where the artist lives in. 5. Contemporary Philippine artists hail from the different regions of the country and they use a wide variety of art media in their creations. These are materials that are readily available in the locality where the artist resides. 6 Contemporary Arts have different elements that are put together to come up with a distinct artwork like Performance, Appropriation, Technology, Hybridity and Space. (Mnemonics: PATHS) 7. The distinct features of Contemporary Philippine Art include Communal, Holistic, Intuitive, Multi-focal, Integrative and Creative Process. (Mnemonics: CHIMIC) 8 Contemporary Philippine Art considers not only the artist but also the participation of the community through the viewers wherein the experience is not solely confined to the creator of the art but also to the viewer of the art. 9. Integrative Art comes in different sizes and shapes, forms and styles as observed in Junk Art which is a sculptural rendition using discarded or used materials. 10. The combination of resourcefulness and creativity can bring out the artist in everyone.​</a>

                            15. what is the main idea below.
- Many learners and teachers have established a wide range of
activities to support approaches to creativity and exploit the features of digital
technologies in processes such as: (a)developing ideas: supporting imaginative
conjecture, exploration and representation of ideas; (b) making connections:
supporting, challenging, informing and developing ideas by making
connections within formation, people, projects and resources; (c) creating and
making: engaging in making meanings though fashioning processes of
capture, manipulation and transformation of media; (d) collaboration:
working with others in immediate and dynamic ways to collaborate on
outcomes and construct shared knowledge; (e) communication and
evaluation: publishing and communicating outcomes for evaluation and
critique from a range of audiences. These activities are not always discrete or
sequential and there can be synchronicity in their expression and overlap of
applications for different purposes. Examples of such activities range from
using simulations and adventure games to explore the question ‘what would
happen if…?’, to publishing hypertext stories or constructing avatars to meet
and interact in three-dimensional, virtual worlds. This wealth of activity
illustrates how children and young people are able to use ICT to demonstrate
creative characteristics in the interaction between people and processes in
subject areas which are authentic, relevant and challenging</h2><br />

Static media this refers to content that doesn’t change. For example, an advertisement in a newspaper or magazine is static, because it remains as printed. It will be the same every time we view it. Static media can also refer to those parts of your website that rarely change. It may include landing pages, homepages and white papers.

Even though I had just received a certification in virtual distance education. During this semester, I found myself teaching a course on contemporary models of psychotherapy. Two weeks after the quarantine began, the unit I would teach on would be expressive therapies. I was thinking how to translate a dynamic application in the classroom into a virtual activity. At that moment it occurred to me, rather than giving a class, my students needed that space to process the new reality of COVID-19. So, not only did I give a virtual class on expressive therapies, I converted the space into an art therapy live application as well. The goal was that each of them from their homes could express themselves from their homes through four drawings, allowing creativity to flow and emphasizing the process, not the result. By discussing the theories, they analyzed their arts meaning, which in turn promoted laughter and participation among them. Also, the group discussions allowed them to find new meanings, named their concerns and see the positive side of it all. But more importantly, it 15​</h2><br />
