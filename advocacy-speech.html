                        <p>WHAT IS ADVOCACY?</p><p></p><p>Before direct action comes planning, and before planning comes an understanding of what needs to be put in the plan. So first, here's a reminder of what advocacy is (as well as what it's not).</p><p></p><p>Advocacy is active promotion of a cause or principle</p><p></p><p>Advocacy involves actions that lead to a selected goal</p><p></p><p>Advocacy is one of many possible strategies, or ways to approach a problem</p><p></p><p>Advocacy can be used as part of a community initiative, nested in with other components.</p><p></p><p>Advocacy is not direct service</p><p></p><p>Advocacy does not necessarily involve confrontation or conflict</p><p></p><p>Some examples may help clarify just what advocacy is:</p><p></p><p>You join a group that helps build houses for the poor--that's wonderful, but it's not advocacy (it's a service)</p><p></p><p>You organize and agitate to get a proportion of apartments in a new development designated as low to moderate income housing - that's advocacy</p><p></p><p>You spend your Saturdays helping sort out goods at the recycling center - that's not advocacy (it's a service)</p><p></p><p>You hear that land used for the recycling center is going to be closed down and you band together with many others to get the city to preserve this site, or find you a new one. Some of you even think about blocking the bulldozers, if necessary - that's advocacy</p><p></p><p>Advocacy usually involves getting government, business, schools, or some other large institution (also known as Goliath) to correct an unfair or harmful situation affecting people in the community (also known as David, and friends). The situation may be resolved through persuasion, by forcing Goliath to buckle under pressure, by compromise, or through political or legal action.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>CRAFTING AN EFFECTIVE ADVOCACY MESSAGE
</p><p>Follow these 6 steps to create a concise, strong advocacy message for any audience.
</p><p>1. Open with a statement that engages your audience. 
</p><p>Make a statement that gets your audience’s attention right away, perhaps using a dramatic fact. 
</p><p>This is your lead-in and should be only a sentence or two. 
</p><p>2. Present the problem. 
</p><p>Describe the problem, who it affects, it impact 
</p><p>3. Provide facts, data about the problem. 
</p><p>Data is important to demonstrate that a problem exists and to support your position. Look for 
</p><p>facts that are relevant to your audience. For instance, state data would be important to a state 
</p><p>legislator or a member of Congress from your state, while facility data would be used when 
</p><p>talking to a nursing home official. 
</p><p>4. Share a story or give an example of the problem.
</p><p>An example or story puts a human face on the issue and makes it real and more compelling. 
</p><p>Again, make sure the example is relevant to your audience, such as an experience a constituent 
</p><p>had in a legislator’s district or a resident had in the administrator’s nursing home).
</p><p>5. Connect the issue to the audience’s values, concerns or self-interest. 
</p><p>Show your audience how this interest fits with what they care about, want or need. Learn what 
</p><p>you can about the person. For example, is the legislator an opponent of “big government?” or a 
</p><p>champion of social issues? Is the nursing home administrator concerned about the facility’s 
</p><p>reputation in the community or about competition with other nursing homes in the area?
</p><p>6. Make your request (the “ask”). 
</p><p>Clearly state what you want the person to do.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>Common Elements:<p></p> Attention and Relevance – establish why the problem is relevant to your audience. Need – use evidence to show that there is a broader societal need for a solution. Satisfaction – show how you satisfy this need with a feasible, credible solution<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Lou Gehrig, “Farewell to Baseball Address”</p><p>2.Demosthenes, “The Third Philippic”</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1.Fans, for the past two weeks you have been reading about a bad break I got. Yet today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth. I have been in ballparks for seventeen years and have never received anything but kindness and encouragement from you fans.
</p><p>
</p><p>Look at these grand men. Which of you wouldn't consider it the highlight of his career to associate with them for even one day?
</p><p>
</p><p>Sure, I'm lucky. Who wouldn't consider it an honor to have known Jacob Ruppert - also the builder of baseball's greatest empire, Ed Barrow - to have spent the next nine years with that wonderful little fellow Miller Huggins - then to have spent the next nine years with that outstanding leader, that smart student of psychology - the best manager in baseball today, Joe McCarthy!
</p><p>
</p><p>Sure, I'm lucky. When the New York Giants, a team you would give your right arm to beat, and vice versa, sends you a gift, that's something! When everybody down to the groundskeepers and those boys in white coats remember you with trophies, that's something.
</p><p>
</p><p>When you have a wonderful mother-in-law who takes sides with you in squabbles against her own daughter, that's something. When you have a father and mother who work all their lives so that you can have an education and build your body, it's a blessing! When you have a wife who has been a tower of strength and shown more courage than you dreamed existed, that's the finest I know.
</p><p>
</p><p>So I close in saying that I might have had a tough break - but I have an awful lot to live for!</p><p></p><p>2.It is this fate, I solemnly assure you, that I dread for you, when the time comes that you make your reckoning, and realize that there is no longer anything that can be done. May you never find yourselves, men of Athens, in such a position! Yet in any case, it were better to die ten thousand deaths, than to do anything out of servility towards Philip [or to sacrifice any of those who speak for your good]. A noble recompense did the people in Oreus receive, for entrusting themselves to Philip's friends, and thrusting Euphraeus aside! And a noble recompense the democracy of Eretria, for driving away your envoys, and surrendering to Cleitarchus! They are slaves, scourged and butchered! A noble clemency did he show to the Olynthians, who elected Lasthenes to command the cavalry, and banished Apollonides! It is folly, and it is cowardice, to cherish hopes like these, to give way to evil counsels, to refuse to do anything that you should do, to listen to the advocates of the enemy's cause, and to fancy that you dwell in so great a city that, whatever happens, you will not suffer any harm.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Hello my name is Zahid Merali and I’m standing in front of you today to talk to you about a very important issues. This issue is poverty in the Philippines. Poverty is a very big issue especially in the Philippines because it affects people just like you and me, people who have dreams and goals but could never imagine of achieving them.  In the Philippines more than 30% of people fall below the poverty line and about 12%  are in extreme poverty meaning they use less than 2 to survive dollars a day. I want everyone here to close their eyes for a moment and try to imagine what I’m about to tell you. Imagine yourself living next to a garbage dump, waking up every morning knowing that there is nothing you can do with your life but try to survive, imagine not being able to eat breakfast and lunch but only eating one small meal a day, Imagine your mom working in a factory with very dangerous machinery and only bringing home a couple dollars after a full day of work. Imagine spending you days looking through the garbage dump trying to find any recyclable material that you can sell. Children just like you and me live like this every day. This work is very dangerous because of the environment  they are at risk of  many diseases such as pneumonia or tuberculosis. This is the life of many children and adults  in the Philippines.</p><p>The poverty level in the Philippine has only gotten worse since 2006 and there are many reason for this. The main one being the rapid growth of the population.  The Philippines has one of the fastest growing populations in the world at 2.3% a year. There has been an increase in more than 4 million poor people since the 1985.  Since the growth of the population  has  quickly increased this  has become a major problem  because there is already insufficient resources to support the population and this also will leave less resources to improve their economy as well as reduces job opportunities and causes more and more to fall below the poverty line. Currently The unemployment is 7.4% .Since the Philippines is a bunch of small islands they face difficulty in job creation due to not being able to attract more foreign investments.</p><p>Over many years the government has been trying to poverty by focusing more on agricultural work in order and try and create more jobs, but this will take many years and by the time these jobs are created more will die. Apart from the government  There has also been help from many people and companies such as the Asian development bank also known as ADB. ADB is an organization that tries to help those in poverty in Asia and the pacific and spread knowledge to others. ADB produced a book called  Poverty in the Philippines causes constraints and opportunities this books explored the many ways  someone could be trapped in poverty.  Many don’t know about this issue and I feel as if that is a big reason why the Philippines are still facing poverty after such a long time.  Poverty- the Philippine scenario is a book written by Ruth S.Callanta that shows you the many different aspects of the life of someone in poverty. Through theses books and through you, we can spread knowledge to those who don’t know about this issue.</p><p>So you may be thinking that you are only one person and that nothing you can do will even make a difference? Well I’m here to tell you that you are wrong and that you can help all those who are in need in many different ways. Philippines charity is a nonprofit organizations that gives 100% of your donation straight to those in need. You can find them at Philippinescharity.com. The reason way I chose to tell you about this charity is because of the unique ways it allows you to help others such as donating money, sending ecards, sending used clothing or even just by letting you click their ads. With each click on their site you are donating money without even knowing. With every donation you could be saving a life or giving someone a way out.</p><p>There is enough in this world for everyone’s need, but not enough for everyone’s greed, this was said by Mahatma Gandhi and I truly believe that this is the truth. It is not the fault of those in poverty but ours because we have the chance to help them and make the world a better place for everyone. With the rising population it will be harder than ever to help those in need but it is not impossible. So please go home talk to your family, talk to your friends get as many people as you can involved and one day I promise you we will see a change.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>#CarryOnLearning<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>P</strong><strong>overty </strong><strong>S</strong><strong>peech in the Philippines</strong><p></p><p>            Hello my name is Alexander San Juan from camarines sur and I’m standing in front of you today to talk to you about a very important issues.
