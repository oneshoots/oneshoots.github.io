                                            There once was a little boy who had a very bad temper. His father decided to hand him a bag of nails and said that every time the by lost his temper, he had to hammer a nail into the fence.
On the first day, the boy hammered 37 nails into that fence. The boy gradually began to control his temper over the next few weeks, and number of nails he was hammering into the fence slowly decreased. He discovered it was easier to control his temper than to hammer those nails into the fence.
Finally, the day came when the boy didn’t lose his temper at all. He told his father the news and the father suggested that the boy should now pull out a nail every day he kept his temper under control.
The days passed and the young boy was finally able to tell his father that all the nails were gone. The father took his son by the hand and led him to the fence.

                        How to help the unemployed during the coronavirus pandemic <p>In the past four weeks, 22 million Americans have filed jobless claims. That staggering number doesn’t even reflect everyone who is truly out of work — just those who have been able to get online and file for unemployment benefits.
</p><p>
</p><p>But not all hope is lost. There are ways to help, even if you’ve been laid off yourself. Here are a few steps you can take to ease the burden.  </p><p>
</p><p>Stress, uncertainty and unanswered questions: Laid off workers cope with unemployment
</p><p>APRIL 10, 202004:22</p><p>
</p>If someone you know has been laid off:
1. Don’t assume you know what they need
<p>Everyone’s situation is a little different, and your perception of a person’s needs may not actually be what they are. Amanda Clayman, a psychotherapist and financial wellness advocate at Prudential, says that losing work isn’t a problem that can be solved overnight. “Sometimes [our assumptions] may be very wrong, and it’s more likely that they will take the shape of our own fears of what they want from us,” she says.
</p>
<p>Clayman says a healthy way to ask what your loved one needs is to listen to your conversations and see what they bring up, whether it is emotional or financial support. Not all help is financial, of course — especially if you are also struggling. “If your friend is in a bad place and you want to help, you can say, ‘I want to help, but I’m worried about the position I’m in, too,’” Clayman advises.</p><p></p>2. Be there for them — again and again
<p>This period of self—isolation can be pretty lonely, and not everyone will need the same kind of interaction. As with many kinds of crises, including death, job loss and illness, Clayman says that loss of friendship is a painful part. “We are afraid of being overwhelmed, we don’t know what to say, we don’t have the power to fix it,” she says.
</p><p>
</p><p>Not every conversation needs to be about the biggest things that are going on. “You can send a funny meme or a gif,” Clayman says. “Signaling your availability is the most important thing to do, even if [the interaction] didn’t go as you hoped.”</p><p></p>3. Respect your loved one’s boundaries — and your own
<p>If you want to help someone you’re close to, you nee</p><p>d to be in tune with their needs and boundaries as well as yours, according to Clayman. “That doesn’t mean we have to react or overreact, but we can recognize the boundary and identify what that feeling is.”
</p><p>

                            22. There once was a little boy who had a very bad temper. His father decided to hand him a bag of nails and said that every time the by lost his temper, he had to hammer a nail into the fence.
On the first day, the boy hammered 37 nails into that fence. The boy gradually began to control his temper over the next few weeks, and number of nails he was hammering into the fence slowly decreased. He discovered it was easier to control his temper than to hammer those nails into the fence.
Finally, the day came when the boy didn’t lose his temper at all. He told his father the news and the father suggested that the boy should now pull out a nail every day he kept his temper under control.
The days passed and the young boy was finally able to tell his father that all the nails were gone. The father took his son by the hand and led him to the fence.
