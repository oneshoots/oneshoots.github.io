The part of an exercise when the activity is performed at its highest peak is called warm-up. 12. When you are dehydrated you are more alert and focused, your reaction time is faster because your muscles respond more quickly and are less likely to cramp, and your endurance is better. 13. The cool-down is an activity that prepares the muscles for work, is the first stage in any physical activity. 14. To gain the most benefit from an exercise program, just include one basic stage for each activity. 15. Select activities that ignores all five areas of health-related fitness. 16. Specificity indicates that exercises and activities improve particular areas of health-related fitness. 17. Your resting heart rate is the number of times your heart beats in one minute when you are not active. 18.

Resting heart rate should be measured first thing in the morning, with your index and middle finger and a stopwatch.22. A warm-up should not consist of light physical activity for 5 to 10 minutes. 23. An effective warm-up increases both the respiratory rate and heart rate. 24. Increasing muscle temperature helps make the muscles loose, supple, and pliable. 25. Warm up activities are crucial parts of any exercise routine or sports training to prepare the body and mind for movement. 26. When you engage in regular physical activity, your body makes physiological changes to adapt to the demands you place on it. 27. For exercise to be beneficial, the work must be done by contracting skeletal muscles. 28. The purpose of warm-up is to elevate the heart and lubricate the joints. 29. One great way to make variations in your exercise program is through cross training. 30. FITT formula is an assessment of the intensity of exercise based on how the participant feels.​</h2><br />
