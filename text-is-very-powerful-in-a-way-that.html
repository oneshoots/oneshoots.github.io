Monsoon Winds and Climate Winds are a powerful force in creating climate. In Asia, the monsoon winds cause huge seasonal changes each year. During the summer, the winds flow from southeast to northwest. This occurs because the land at that time of the year is warmer than the ocean. The hot air over the land rises. The air from the ocean flows toward the land. These winds carry moist air, which causes long periods of heavy rain. Summer is not a good time for tourists to visit. During winter, the winds blow in the opposite direction. At this time of the year, the land is colder than the ocean. The air over the ocean rises. Winds move from land to sea, northwest to southeast. These winds are very dry. During this season, there is little rainfall. Large earthquakes can cause tidal waves along the coasts of Asia.

A tsunami is a fast-moving giant wave traveling towards a coastline which can destroy structures and objects along its way. It sometimes happens during a very strong earthquake located out in the sea. Depending on its size, the height of a tsunami may be as tall as an average person or as high as an electric post. No one really knows how big it can grow. A tsunami may also take place during powerful storms such as super typhoons. As strong storms approach, they may push waves to form a tsunami. Because of the destructive power of a tsunami, people must be alert and ready for them. ● ● What is the text about? What does the text present? What type of text is this? ​</a>

Monsoon Winds and Climate Winds are a powerful force in creating climate. In Asia, the monsoon winds cause huge seasonal changes each year. During the summer, the winds flow from southeast to northwest. This occurs because the land at that time of the year is warmer than the ocean. The hot air over the land rises. The air from the ocean flows toward the land. These winds carry moist air, which causes long periods of heavy rain. Summer is not a good time for tourists to visit. During winter, the winds blow in the opposite direction. At this time of the year, the land is colder than the ocean. The air over the ocean rises. Winds move from land to sea, northwest to southeast. These winds are very dry. During this season, there is little rainfall. Large earthquakes can cause tidal waves along the coasts of Asia.

A tsunami is a fast-moving giant wave traveling towards a coastline which can destroy structures and objects along its way. It sometimes happens during a very strong earthquake located out in the sea. Depending on its size, the height of a tsunami may be as tall as an average person or as high as an electric post. No one really knows how big it can grow. A tsunami may also take place during powerful storms such as super typhoons. As strong storms approach, they may push waves to form a tsunami. Because of the destructive power of a tsunami, people must be alert and ready for them. ● ● What is the text about? What does the text present? What type of text is this? ​</h2><br />

Monsoon Winds and Climate Winds are a powerful force in creating climate. In Asia, the monsoon winds cause huge seasonal changes each year. During the summer, the winds flow from southeast to northwest. This occurs because the land at that time of the year is warmer than the ocean. The hot air over the land rises. The air from the ocean flows toward the land. These winds carry moist air, which causes long periods of heavy rain. Summer is not a good time for tourists to visit. During winter, the winds blow in the opposite direction. At this time of the year, the land is colder than the ocean. The air over the ocean rises. Winds move from land to sea, northwest to southeast. These winds are very dry. During this season, there is little rainfall. Large earthquakes can cause tidal waves along the coasts of Asia.
