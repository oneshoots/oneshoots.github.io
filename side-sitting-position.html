3.During a recent hockey game, Wayne Gruntsky shot the puck straight along the ice at goalie Vince Trembling. Vince had an unusual stick with a semicircular curved blade which he held motionless on the ice surface. We don’t know the speed, mass or dimensions involved, but the small puck came in tangent to the large blade at one side, slid around with no friction, and left the other side moving along the ice in the opposite direction. What answer should result if you divide the magnitude of the maximum horizontal force exerted on the puck by the magnitude of the average horizontal force exerted on the puck during the time it was in contact with the 
curved blade?

3.During a recent hockey game, Wayne Gruntsky shot the puck straight along the ice at goalie Vince Trembling. Vince had an unusual stick with a semicircular curved blade which he held motionless on the ice surface. We don’t know the speed, mass or dimensions involved, but the small puck came in tangent to the large blade at one side, slid around with no friction, and left the other side moving along the ice in the opposite direction. What answer should result if you divide the magnitude of the maximum horizontal force exerted on the puck by the magnitude of the average horizontal force exerted on the puck during the time it was in contact with the 
curved blade?
